## Use "enable", not "allow"

**Allow** is another way of saying permit.

> Example: Knock permits you to send notifications to your users.

**Enable** means providing the means or opportunity.

> Example: Knock enables you to ship in-app notifications in a day.

## Knock product names are proper nouns and should be capitalized, unless being used as a verb

Here is a list of Knock product names (singular/plural) that should be capitalized:
* Agent Toolkit
* Management API

Best practice is to not use Knock product names as verbs. Use a synonym instead. 

If you must use a Knock product name as a verb, do not capitalize the word. 

## Knock concept or feature names are not proper nouns and should not be capitalized
Here is a list of Knock concept/feature names that should not be capitalized unless at beginning of sentence:
* Guides
* Workflows
* Broadcasts
* Tenants
* Users
* Objects
* Translations
* Schedules
* Subscriptions
* Preferences
* Messages
* Environments
* Audiences

## Case: always use sentence case
We always use sentence case, even for titles. This means that a header should always be capitalized as "How Knock works" and not "How Knock Works". The only exception to this rule is for proper nouns (i.e. Knock products such as Broadcasts).

## Avoid adverbs
We avoid using adverbs in our writing. 

They are often unnecessary, and they lead to copy that is trying too hard to convince our audience of something. 

Example:

- With adverb: "The delay step is **incredibly** useful for scheduling reminders or other longer lived notifications."
- Without adverb: "The delay step is useful for scheduling reminders or other longer lived notifications."

## Oxford comma
We use the oxford comma.

## No exclamation marks
We don't use exclamation marks in our blog post copy or our documentation. Okay to use them in social posts.

## We don't use "&"
Best to use "and" or if you need shorthand use "+".

## American, not British spelling
We use American English spelling throughout our docs. An example: "cancellation" not "cancelation", and "canceled" not "cancelled". (As you can see, "cancel", an important word in the Knock API, is an especially tricky word to stay consistent on between American and British English.)

## API should always be all caps
API, never api or Api

## Images
Images should always use Image component, rounded-md, mx-auto, border, border-gray-200.
