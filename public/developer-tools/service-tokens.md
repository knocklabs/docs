A Knock account service token allows for secure access against the Knock [Management API](/developer-tools/management-api) and [CLI](/developer-tools/knock-cli). It acts as an authentication mechanism for resources under your Knock account.

Service tokens always start with `knock_st_` and are different from your Knock API keys as they authenticate requests to the Knock management API **only**.

      Note: <strong>only account owners or admins</strong> have the privilege to
      generate (or revoke) service tokens. Service tokens will inherit the
      privilege of the owner or the admin that creates the service token, and
      therefore have full access to the management API.
    </>
  }

## Generating a new service token

To use the management API or CLI, you will first need to generate a service token and use it as a means of authentication when sending requests.

To generate a service token, from the dashboard go to "Settings," select the "Service tokens" tab, and click the "+ New token" button. Then, provide a name for the token and click "generate" to view and save your newly generated service token.

      <strong>
        you cannot see a service token again from the Knock dashboard,
      </strong>{" "}
      so be sure to copy it to a secure location.
    </>
  }

## Revoking a service token

Service tokens can be revoked under the three-dot menu and by clicking on "Delete token." Deleting a token will **immediately** revoke its ability to be used against the Knock management API and CLI.

## Frequently asked questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I use a Knock service token against the Knock API?">
    No, a service token can only be used against the Knock Management API and
    not the Knock API.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How can I know which changes were made by a specific service token?">
    Changes made via the Management API will appear as audit logs, similar to
    changes made manually in the dashboard, but attributing the service token
    used to make the change as the author. In addition, internally we audit
    requests and tie them back to a corresponding service token. If you need
    further help understanding which request originated from a service token,
    please [contact our support team](mailto:support@knock.app).
