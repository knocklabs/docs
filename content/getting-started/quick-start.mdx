In this guide, you'll integrate Knock with your backend web application and send your first notification using Knock.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Knock account">
    First, [create a Knock account](https://dashboard.knock.app/signup) if you don't already have one and log into the [Knock dashboard](https://dashboard.knock.app).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add the Knock SDK to your backend">
    We have SDKs available in [most major languages](/sdks/overview#server-side-sdks). Don't see your language listed here? [Let us know](mailto:support@knock.app)!

    <MultiLangCodeBlock snippet="sdks.install" title="Install Knock" />

  </Step>
  <Step title="Set up environment variables">
    You can find your public and secret API keys under the **Developers** section of the Knock dashboard. Since we're working on the backend here, you'll want to use the secret key.

    As a best practice, your API key should be set as an environment variable and should not be checked into source control.

    ```bash
    KNOCK_API_KEY='sk_example_123456789'
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a workflow in Knock">
    Next we'll design our first workflow in Knock via the dashboard.

    A workflow encapsulates a notification in Knock. Each workflow takes a trigger call via the Knock API, runs the data you provide through a set of logic you configure, and outputs the actual messages that will be sent to your end users. All channel routing and message design takes place within the workflow.

    Here's how to build your first workflow:
    <AccordionGroup>
      <Accordion title="Create a workflow">
        Click the "+ Workflow" button in the top right corner of the Knock dashboard. Name it whatever you like.
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="Add a channel step">
        To send a notification, a workflow needs at least one [channel step](/designing-workflows/channel-step). To add this step, we'll click “edit steps” to enter the workflow canvas editor.

        Here we can see a number of steps available for us to add to our workflow, including functions (such as [batch](/designing-workflows/batch-function) and [delay](/designing-workflows/delay-function)) and channels.

        Choose the delivery channel you'd like to use in your workflow and drag it onto the workflow canvas.
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="Design the notification message">
        After adding a channel step, we can configure the notification's content by clicking on "Edit template" in the channel's edit step view to see that step's [message template](/designing-workflows/template-editor/overview). The template starts with default copy, so we'll just use that for now.
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="Grab trigger payload">
        Before we leave the workflow canvas and head back to your backend, let’s click on the trigger step to grab a payload data sample to use when we call Knock.

        This sample payload is auto-generated when you create a workflow within the Knock dashboard. It gives us the JSON blob we'll need to pass through as `data` in our trigger call in order to populate any of the custom properties defined in our workflow.
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="Commit the workflow to development">
        Knock follows a versioning model similar to Git. This means that before you can trigger your new workflow via the API, you'll need to commit it to your current environment to activate the workflow.

        Click the back arrow in the top-left corner of the workflow canvas to get back to the workflow overview page, where you can commit your changes.
      </Accordion>
    </AccordionGroup>
    Now we're ready to trigger our workflow via the Knock API. You can also learn more about workflows and channels in Knock via our [guide on designing workflows](/send-notifications/designing-workflows).

  </Step>
  <Step title="Trigger your workflow">
    Now, you'll trigger your workflow to notify a set of users. When triggering workflows, you need to provide the following required pieces of data in your call to the Knock API:

    - `recipients` – The list of users to notify.
    - `data` – The variable data that will populate your notification templates. Here you'll use the sample data payload we grabbed in step 3.

    In the example below, we trigger a new comment notification workflow for two project members, using [inline identification](/reference#trigger-workflow-inline-identify).

    <MultiLangCodeBlock
      snippet="workflows.trigger-with-user-identification"
      title="Trigger your workflow"
    />

    Learn more about trigger calls in our [API reference](/reference#trigger-workflow).

  </Step>
  <Step title="Publish to production">
    Knock uses [logically separated environments](/send-and-manage-data/environments) to control the roll-out of your notifications. When you're happy with the way your workflows work and look, you just need to promote them to production to start sending notifications to your real users.

    See our guide on [going to production](/getting-started/going-to-production) to review a complete set of steps you'll need to take to push your workflows to production.
