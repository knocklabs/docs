You might run into the scenario where you've identified an invited user to send them a notification and then that user "graduates" to a fully-fledged user after they sign up, leaving you with two users in Knock. That's where the merge users method comes in handy.

Merging two users will merge the `secondary` user (the invited user in our example) into the `primary` user (the signed-up user), and the secondary user will be deleted in the process.

### What's merged?

- **Properties**: Properties are deep merged, but if there are any conflicts between the secondary and primary user then the value is selected from the primary user.
- **Preferences**: Preference sets are shallow merged between the users. Any preference sets that don't exist on the primary from the secondary are added.
- **Channel data**: Channel data is shallow merged from the secondary to the primary. Any channel data that doesn't exist on the primary from the secondary is added, determined by the channel_id.
- **Message history**: The past 30 days of message history of the secondary user will now be owned by the primary recipient.
- **Activities**: Any activities from the past 30 days that the secondary user was an `actor` or `recipient` of will be transferred to the primary user.

If you need to retain more than 30 days worth of history, please contact us.
