Knock provides a programmatic user deletion API that you can use to hard delete users and the data associated with users. This can be especially useful in fulfilling GDPR right-to-be-forgotten requests.

## What data is deleted for a user?

When a user is deleted in Knock, we will **hard delete**:

- All system and custom properties set on the user
- All preferences associated with the user
- All channel data associated with the user
- All subscriptions associated with the user
- All schedules associated with the user
- All messages sent to that user, including the content of those messages and any debugging events associated
- All activity associated with a user, including the workflow run logs the user was a recipient of

**Note**: deletion requests can take up to 10 minutes to process. During this time, you may still see some data associated with the user.
