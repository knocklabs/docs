You can use send windows to specify when a channel step should send a message. For example, if you want to ensure your customers don’t receive a given transactional email from your product outside of working hours, you can set send windows for Monday - Friday, between 9:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. local user time.

Messages generated outside of this window will be [queued](https://docs.knock.app/send-notifications/message-statuses#3-queued) until the next open window, at which time Knock will resume delivery to the downstream provider.

  title="Send windows do not pause workflow execution."
  text="As soon as a channel step generates a message, the workflow will proceed to the next step, even if that message is queued due to a send window.  If your workflow has subsequent delay steps, consider how those delays may interact with your send windows to avoid misaligned timing."
/>

Send windows are evaluated using the recipient's local time, specified by the user `timezone` [property](/concepts/users#optional-attributes). If the user's timezone is not set, the [account default timezone](/manage-your-account/account-timezone) will be used.

## Modeling send windows

Knock models send windows as a list of send window objects. Each day must have 1 send window specified.

The send window object has the following properties:

| Property | Description                                                                                                                                      |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `day`    | Day of the week. One of: ”monday”, ”tuesday”, ”wednesday”, ”thursday”, ”friday”, ”saturday”, ”sunday”.                                           |
| `type`   | Whether notifications should be sent or not sent for this send window. One of: ”send”, ”do_not_send”.                                            |
| `from`   | An optional ISO-8601 time-only format string specifying the start of the window (defaults to 00:00:00). Only supported if type is set to ”send”. |
| `until`  | An optional ISO-8601 time-only format string specifying the end of the window (defaults to end of day). Only supported if type is set to ”send”. |

In our JSON representation this will look something like:

```json title="Example send window"
{
  "day": "monday",
  "type": "send",
  "from": "09:00:00",
  "until": "17:00:00"
}
```

## The send windows editor

When creating or modifying a channel step, you can use the send window editor to configure send windows. If notifications are enabled for a given day of the week, you can also specify the time range during which messages will be sent on that day.
