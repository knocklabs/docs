Partials are reusable pieces of content you can use across any of your channel templates. HTML partials can be enabled as "blocks" for use in Knockâ€™s drag-and-drop email editor.

In this page, we'll walk through how to create partials and use them in your templates using Knock's code editor or visual editor.

## Managing partials

### Creating and editing partial properties

To get started, navigate to **Content** > **Partials** in the main sidebar where you can create a new partial.

When creating or editing partials, you can use the following properties:

| Property      | Description                                                                                                         |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Name`        | A name for your partial.                                                                                            |
| `Key`         | A unique key for your partial. Cannot be edited after creation.                                                     |
| `Type`        | The type of content you want to create. One of HTML, markdown, plaintext, or JSON. Cannot be edited after creation. |
| `Description` | An optional description of your partial.                                                                            |
| `Is block`    | Whether or not to enable this partial as a block within the visual editor (HTML partials only).                     |
| `Icon name`   | An icon to display for this partial within the visual editor.                                                       |

Partials are environment-specific and follow the same [version control model](/concepts/commits) as the rest of Knock.

### Creating partial content

After creating a partial, you can edit its content in the code editor.

You can include Liquid variables in your content which will be scoped to your partial. When using the partial in a template, you can pass in values for these variables. To include a variable in your partial, use the following syntax: `{{ variable_name }}`.

<Callout
  type="alert"
  title="Note:"
  text={
    <>
      Partials must be committed (or promoted) before they can be used by
      templates in a given environment. Templates will always use the published
      version of a partial.
      <br />
      <br />
      If you're using a partial that is not yet committed while editing a template,
      you will not see your latest changes.
    </>
  }
/>

#### Editing HTML partial content

HTML partials display a preview alongside the editor. Open the preview by clicking the "Preview" button or using the `Cmd + ]` keyboard shortcut on Mac, or `Ctrl + ]` on Windows.

- Select an [email layout](/integrations/email/layouts) to preview the partial within.
- Use the `<style>` tag to add CSS to your partial, which will be inlined when rendering your email messages.
- Edit the placeholder variable values in the preview sidebar. These values are just for the preview and will not be used in your final messages. The preview text will also appear alongside the variable name in the code editor typeahead information.

### Updating existing partial content

To update the content of an existing partial, you can return to the partial's code editor.

When you commit or promote your changes, they will be immediately applied to all templates that use the partial in that environment. If you add or remove variables from your partial, you'll want to be sure to update the input values for those variables in any layouts or message templates that use your partial before promoting your changes to higher environments.

### Archiving partials

Partials can be archived from the "Partials" page or from a specific partial's details page.

<Callout
  type="alert"
  title="Note:"
  text={
    <>
      If an archived partial is used in a template, it will continue to render
      until the workflow containing that template is published again.
      <br />
      <br />
      After the workflow has been published, the partial will not render in your
      messages.
    </>
  }
/>

## Using partials in templates

Partials can be used in templates with the code editor or visual editor.

You can also include partials in other partials. Knock will render partials recursively up to a maximum depth of 5.

<Callout
  type="alert"
  title="Partial variable inputs currently only support plaintext values."
  text={
    <>
      This means that booleans, lists, and other JSON values will be treated as
      strings when passed into a partial. See the{" "}
      <a href="#frequently-asked-questions">frequently asked questions</a> below
      for common implementation patterns.

  }

### In the code editor

Use partials by using the render tag with the following syntax: `{% render 'partial_key' %}`. You can also use the partial button in the toolbar to insert a partial.

Pass variables into your partial using the following syntax: `{% render 'partial_key', variable_name: 'value' %}`. You can pass in plaintext values or Liquid expressions like `{% render 'partial_key', variable_name: data.variable_name %}`.

The Knock render tag does not support the `for` and `with` modifiers.

To replicate the `for` modifier, use the Liquid `for` block.

```liquid title="Partials in a loop"
{% for item in data.items %}
  {% render 'partial_key', variable_name: item.value %}
{% endfor %}
```

To replicate the `with` modifier, use the `{% assign %}` tag to re-assign a variable.

```liquid title="Alternative to the 'with' modifier"
{% assign item = data.item %}
{% render 'partial_key', variable_name: item.value %}
```

### In the visual editor

HTML partials can be used in the visual editor if they are enabled as blocks. Add a partial to your template by dragging it from the "Custom blocks" section of the sidebar into the template.

Click a custom block to open the inspect panel to edit variable values. You can enter a plaintext value or a Liquid expression like `{{ data.variable_name }}`.

## Frequently asked questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why can't I see my partial in the editor or preview?">
    To use a partial in the visual editor, it must be an HTML partial and enabled as a block.

    Partials must be committed before they can be used
    by templates in a given environment. Templates will always use the
    published version of a partial.

    If you're using a partial that is not yet committed while editing a template, you will not see your latest changes.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="My trigger data includes an array of items. How can I iterate over the items in a partial?">
    Because partial variable inputs currently only support plaintext values, you can't pass a JSON array of items to a partial variable and then iterate over them within the partial's content.

    Instead, you can use a placeholder variable in your partial that will contain the final, rendered list of items. You'll then provide the Liquid iteration logic in the template that renders the partial when you configure the input value for the partial variable.

    For example, if you have a partial that renders a list of items, you can use a placeholder variable in your partial:

    ```liquid title="Partial with a placeholder variable"
    <ul>
      {{ items_list }}
    </ul>
    ```

    Then, in the message template that renders the partial, you can provide the Liquid logic to iterate over the items as the input value for `{{ items_list }}`:

    ```liquid title="Partial variable input in the template editor"
    {% for item in data.items %}
      <li>{{ item.name }}: {{ item.value }}</li>
    {% endfor %}
    ```

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I use boolean values from my trigger data in a partial?">
    Yes, but not directly as `true` or `false` values. Because variable inputs for partials currently only support plaintext values, boolean inputs will be treated as strings when passed into a partial. This means that a boolean value of `false` will be treated as the string `"false"` in your partial's content, which evaluates as truthy in Liquid.
    
    Rather than referencing a boolean value in your partial's content like this:

    ```liquid title="Incorrect boolean reference in a partial"
    {% if boolean_value %}
      <p>The value is true.</p>
    {% endif %}
    ```

    You can use a Liquid expression to check the string value of the boolean input:

    ```liquid title="Correct boolean reference in a partial"
    {% if boolean_value == "true" %}
      <p>The value is true.</p>
    {% endif %}
    ```

    Because empty strings are also truthy in Liquid, if you'd like to check whether or not a value was provided to a partial at runtime you can use the `blank` object:

    ```liquid title="Check if an input value exists"
    {% if input_value != blank %}
      <p>The input value is not an empty string.</p>
    {% endif %}
    ```

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I reference template editor variables like `recipient`, `current_message`, or `workflow` within a partial's content?">
    Not directly. Liquid variables in your partials are scoped to the partial itself, and serve as placeholders for values that you'll configure within your message templates that use the partial.

    To reference [variables](/designing-workflows/template-editor/variables) like `recipient`, `current_message`, or `workflow` within a partial, you can use a placeholder variable in your partial and configure the input value in the template editor to reference these values.

    ```liquid title="Use a recipient property in a partial"
      {% render 'partial_key', recipient_name: recipient.name %}
    ```

  </Accordion>
