A channel step within a workflow is the building block to produce a notification for a recipient. Channel steps house your notification templates and represent a notification to be delivered on a single channel type (e.g. email, push, SMS, in-app, etc).

For a channel step to be valid it must have a [channel or channel group](/integrations/overview#channel-specific-features) associated with it.

## Channel step execution

When a channel step is executed Knock does the following:

1. Runs through any [step conditions](/designing-workflows/step-conditions) to see if the step should be executed.
2. Checks the recipient has the information required to send notifications via this channel. (e.g. for an email channel, do they have an `email` address set? For a push channel do they have the [required channel data](/send-notifications/setting-channel-data) configured?)
3. Checks the [recipient's preferences](/preferences/overview) to see if they have opted out from receiving notifications on this channel or from this workflow.
4. Checks the channel's [send windows](/designing-workflows/send-windows) to see if the notification should be sent now or at a later time.

If the step continues, Knock will render [the template](/designing-workflows/template-editor) associated with the step and enqueue a message to [deliver to the provider](/send-notifications/delivering-notifications) via the configured credentials on the channel.

## Channel support

You can read more about configuring channels in our [integrations overview](/integrations/overview).

### In-app notifications

The Knock [Feed API](/api-reference/users/feeds) gives developers a way to deliver in-app notifications to feeds, inboxes, and other notification-based experiences.

There are a few ways to power in-app notifications in your product using Knock:

- **Use our [React SDK](https://github.com/knocklabs/javascript/tree/main/packages/react).** The Knock notification feed component provides real-time updates, pagination, badge behavior, filtering, and more. It's a great way to quickly add an in-app feed to your product if you use React.
- **Leverage our [client-side JS SDK](https://github.com/knocklabs/javascript/tree/main/packages/client).** This is a good approach if you need to use a component library outside of React JS but are still in the JS ecosystem.
- **Integrate with our [API directly](/api-reference/users/feeds).** If you're not working within the JS ecosystem in your client, you can integrate directly with the Knock Feed API to power your in-app notifications.

### Out-of-app channels

We support notification delivery to the following out-of-app channel types: [email](/integrations/email/overview), [push](/integrations/push/overview), [SMS](/integrations/sms/overview), and 3rd-party [chat apps](/integrations/chat/overview) (such as Slack). You can see a list of which providers we support within each channel type in the **Integrations** > **Channels** section of the Knock dashboard.
