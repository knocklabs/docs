An update object function updates an [object](/concepts/objects) in a collection stored in Knock as a step in your workflow. Use it when you need to change an object's properties based on workflow context so that downstream steps or other workflows see the updated data.

Common use cases include syncing object state from your trigger (for example, status or last activity), updating channel data on an object (for example, a Slack channel id), or storing data on the object that you reference later when the object is used as a recipient in another workflow. The update object step works the same way as [Update user](/send-notifications/designing-workflows/update-user-function) and [Update tenant](/send-notifications/designing-workflows/update-tenant-function) except that you must always specify which object to update (there is no "current object" mode).

## Selecting the collection and object

The update object step does **not** support a "current object" mode. You must specify which object to update.

- **Collection.** Choose from all [object collections](/concepts/objects) in your environment (for example, "Projects" or "Repositories").
- **Object id.** Select a property that resolves to the object id within that collection, or use a literal object id. This can come from your trigger data (for example, `data.project_id`), from the recipient when the recipient is an object (`recipient.id`), or from another source in the workflow run.

## Setting properties

You can set any number of properties on the object. Each property has a **key** and a **value**.

- **Key.** The property name. You can set a value for an existing object property or define a new property.
- **Value.** The value to set. You can use [Liquid](/template-editor/overview) (for example, `{{ data.status }}` or `{{ recipient.name }}`) so the value is resolved from workflow data, the recipient, the actor, or [variables](/concepts/variables). You can also use a static value (for example, `"active"` or `true`).

In the step editor you can edit properties as a JSON blob or in key-value form. Updated properties are stored in Knock and are available to subsequent workflow steps and to the Management API.

## Debugging

You can use the [workflow run logs](/send-notifications/debugging-workflows) to debug update object steps. The logs capture the change made by the step so you can verify the pre-state, the properties that were set, and the post-state.

Update object steps are also available in the [Management API](/mapi-reference) and can be included when you show or upsert a workflow.
