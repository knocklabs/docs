An update tenant function updates a [tenant](/concepts/tenants) stored in Knock as a step in your workflow. Use it when you need to change a tenant's properties based on workflow context so that downstream steps or other workflows see the updated data.

Common use cases include syncing tenant state from your trigger (for example, approval status or feature flags), updating [tenant-level preference defaults](/preferences/tenant-preferences), or storing data on the tenant that you reference later in the same workflow or in another workflow. The update tenant step works the same way as [Update user](/send-notifications/designing-workflows/update-user-function) and [Update object](/send-notifications/designing-workflows/update-object-function) except for how you specify which entity to update.

## Selecting the tenant

By default, Knock updates the tenant associated with the current workflow run (the `tenant` you passed in the [trigger](/send-notifications/triggering-workflows) or that is otherwise in scope). You can leave this default, or select a property that resolves to a tenant id (or use a literal tenant id) to update a different tenant.

## Setting properties

You can set any number of properties on the tenant. Each property has a **key** and a **value**.

- **Key.** The property name. You can set a value for an existing tenant property or define a new property.
- **Value.** The value to set. You can use [Liquid](/template-editor/overview) (for example, `{{ data.tenant_name }}` or `{{ tenant.id }}`) so the value is resolved from workflow data, the recipient, the actor, or [variables](/concepts/variables). You can also use a static value (for example, `"Acme Corp"` or `true`).

In the step editor you can edit properties as a JSON blob or in key-value form. Updated properties are stored in Knock and are available to subsequent workflow steps and to the Management API.

## Debugging

You can use the [workflow run logs](/send-notifications/debugging-workflows) to debug update tenant steps. The logs capture the change made by the step so you can verify the pre-state, the properties that were set, and the post-state.

Update tenant steps are also available in the [Management API](/mapi-reference) and can be included when you show or upsert a workflow.
