When you build workflows in Knock, we auto-generate certain pieces of state (as a result of batch functions and other workflow steps) that you can use to control the copy you display to your end users in your notification templates.

| Variable           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| `activities`       | A list of the activity objects included within the batch, where each activity equals the state sent across in your trigger call, and also includes the actor who performed the message and a timestamp of when the activity occurred. |
