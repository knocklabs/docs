Preference conditions are [Knock condition models](/send-and-manage-data/conditions) that are evaluated when computing the current state of your preferences during workflow execution.

## Overview

Typically, a `PreferenceSet` evaluates to boolean values representing if your recipient has opted in or out of receiving notifications on a given channel, workflow, or category.

With preference conditions you can add additional custom expressions to a `PreferenceSet`, where the notification is only sent if all preferences (including the preference condition statement) evaluate to `true`.

Below is an example of a workflow preference that has conditions applied to determine if the preference is `true` or `false`:

```json title="An example of preferences with conditions"
{
  "id": "default",
  "workflows": {
    "dinosaurs-loose": {
      "conditions": [
        {
          "variable": "recipient.muted_dinos",
          "operator": "not_contains",
          "argument": "data.dino"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
