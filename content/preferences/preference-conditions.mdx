Preference conditions are [Knock condition models](/concepts/conditions) that are evaluated when computing the current state of your preferences during workflow execution.

## Overview

Typically, a `PreferenceSet` evaluates to boolean values representing whether your recipient has opted in or out of receiving notifications on a given channel, workflow, or category.

With preference conditions you can add additional custom expressions to a `PreferenceSet`, where the notification is only sent if all preferences (including every condition in the preference `conditions` list) evaluate to `true` at runtime.

Below is an example of a workflow preference that has conditions applied to determine if the preference is `true` or `false`:

```json title="An example of preferences with conditions"
{
  "id": "default",
  "workflows": {
    "dinosaurs-loose": {
      "conditions": [
        {
          "variable": "recipient.muted_dinos",
          "operator": "not_contains",
          "argument": "data.dino"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Frequently asked questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Where can I use preference conditions?">
    A condition can be applied at different points in the preference set:

    - Inside `workflows`, `categories`, or `channel_types` preferences
    - Inside an individual `workflows[workflow].channel_types` preference
    - Inside an individual `categories[category].channel_types` preference

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I debug preference conditions?">
    Knock will capture conditions evaluation details for all preference conditions resolved while executing your workflows. See the [guide on debugging conditions](/concepts/conditions#debugging-conditions) for more info.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I use multiple conditions on a single preference?">
    Yes. You can use multiple conditions within a single preference `conditions` array. Note that all conditions in the array must evaluate to `true` in order for the notification to be sent; this is a logical `AND` operation.

    ```json title="An example of multiple conditions on a single preference"
    {
      "conditions": [
        {
          "variable": "recipient.muted_dinos",
          "operator": "not_contains",
          "argument": "data.dino"
        },
        {
          "variable": "recipient.id",
          "operator": "not_equal_to",
          "argument": "actor.id"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I set OR conditions on a preference?">
    No, this is not currently supported. Each condition in the `conditions` array must evaluate to `true` for a notification to be sent.
