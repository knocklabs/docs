[Preferences](/api-reference/recipients/preferences) enable your users to opt-out of the notifications you send using Knock.

## How preferences work

A user has a <a href="/api-reference/recipients/preferences">`PreferenceSet`</a>. A `PreferenceSet` is a JSON object that tells Knock which channels, categories, and/or workflows a user has opted out of receiving.

When Knock runs a workflow for a user, we evaluate their `PreferenceSet`. A message will not send if the user has opted out of receiving it.

A preference set is built using three keys: `categories`, `channel_types`, `workflows`. These keys resolve to boolean values to determine if a user has opted out of receiving a notification.

A recipient's `default` preference set also has a `commercial_unsubscribe` key which determines if the recipient should receive notifications sent by commercial workflows or broadcasts. Read more about commercial unsubscribe [here](/preferences/commercial-unsubscribe).

A few examples:

```json title="Unsubscribe user from admin category notifications"
{
  "categories": { "admin": false }
}
```

<br/>
```json title="Unsubscribe user from email notifications"
{
  "channel_types": { "email": false }
}
```
<br/>
```json title="Unsubscribe user from at-mention notifications"
{
  "workflows": { "mention": false }
}
```

You can combine these keys to create preference grids like the one in the image below:

```json title="A preference grid for categories and channels"
{
  "categories": {
    "collaboration": {
      "channel_types": {
        "email": true,
        "in_app_feed": true
      }
    },
    "project-updates": {
      "channel_types": {
        "email": false,
        "in_app_feed": true
      }
    }
  },
  "workflows": {
    "invoice-issued": {
      "channel_types": {
        "email": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The `PreferenceSet` above models this preference grid in your application:

  }

## Build your preference center

Before you start setting preferences for your users, you need to build a preference center in your application. A preference center is a place where users can manage their notification preferences.

There are four steps to building a preference center with Knock:

<Steps titleSize="h3">
  <Step title="Create a default PreferenceSet">
    A default preference set is the `PreferenceSet` users default to using when they first sign up for your product. Any users who don't have a preference set will default to using the default preference set. You can create a default preference set in the Knock dashboard under **Platform** > **Preferences**.

    <Image
      src="/images/concepts/preferences/preferences default set environment.png"
      alt="Creating a default preference set in Knock dashboard"
      width={1331}
      height={737}
      className="rounded-md mx-auto border border-gray-200"
    />


    The default preference set is environment-specific for testing purposes. You can copy the default preference set from one environment to another to keep your environments in sync.
    <Callout
      emoji="💡"
      title="A note on merging preferences."
      text={
        <>
          If you create either an environment or tenant default{" "}
          <code>PreferenceSet</code> those preferences will be merged with changes
    a user makes in the UI, with the user-specified changes taking
          precedence. See <a href="#merging-preferences">Merging preferences</a> for more information.
        </>
      }
    />

  </Step>
  {/* TODO: We need to scope and build this with Chris then can add this step.
  <Step title="Create a PreferenceView">

    A `PreferenceView` defines the user-facing labels for any workflows or categories in your default preference set. This enables you to introduce new keys into your default preference set and have them update in your preference center, without needing to make changes within your codebase.

    You can create your `PreferenceView` in the Knock dashboard under **Platform** > **Preferences**. Your `PreferenceView` will be environment-specific for testing purposes. You can copy the `PreferenceView` from one environment to another to keep them in sync.

  </Step> */}
  <Step title="Get a user's preferences">
    {/* TODO add once we have pre-built react component for prefs
    You can use our pre-built React component to render your preference center in your application. Here's an example of how you can use the component:

    ```jsx
    TODO: We need this component built and documented.
    ``` */}

    Once you have your default `PreferenceSet` created, you will use the `getPreferences` method to retrieve a user's preferences for rendering in your application. If no preferences are set, this method will return the default preference set you created in the step above.

    <MultiLangCodeBlock
      title="Get preferences for a user"
      snippet="users.getPreferences"
    />

  </Step>
  <Step title="Render your preference center">
    {/* TODO add once we have pre-built react component for prefs
    You can use our pre-built React component to render your preference center in your application. Here's an example of how you can use the component:

    ```jsx
    TODO: We need this component built and documented.
    ``` */}

    Once you have loaded a user's preference, you'll need to render an interface in your application so they can update their notification preferences. Typically you encapsulate all of the getting and setting of preferences in a single component.

    You can see an example of this below, but our [quickstart documentation on building preferences UI](/in-app-ui/react/preferences) provides an in-depth walkthrough of how to build a functional `PreferenceCenter` component.

```jsx title="A basic preference center"

  width={1184}
  height={714}
  className="rounded-md mx-auto border border-gray-200"
/>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Set a user's preferences">
    When a user makes changes to their preferences in your application, you will use the `setPreferences` method to save those changes back to Knock.

    By default, the `setPreferences` method will overwrite any existing `PreferenceSet` with the new preferences provided. You can learn more about how to update a single preference in the [frequently asked questions](#frequently-asked-questions) section below.

## Merging preferences

When a default `PreferenceSet` exists for an environment or tenant, Knock will merge all applicable preferences for a recipient when evaluating whether or not to send a notification. Any preferences set at the recipient level will take precedence in the merge, according to the hierarchy outlined below.

### Merge hierarchy

The following hierarchies are used when merging preferences.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Standard preference merge hierarchy">
    The following standard hierarchy is used to merge preferences when no `tenant` is applied to the workflow trigger. Each item in the list takes precedence over the ones that follow it:
    
    1. A recipient's `default` preference set
    2. The environment-level default preference set

    Let's take a look at an example to visualize this merge. Suppose that you have the following preference sets:
    <Image
      src="/images/concepts/preferences/standard-prefs-start.png"
      alt="A visual of the environment default and recipient default preference sets prior to merging"
      width={400}
      height={900}
      className="rounded-md mx-auto border border-gray-200"
    />
    <br />

    To visualize the resulting merged preferences, we'll start at the bottom of the hierarchy and work our way up, adding any preferences from the environment default preference set that are not already present in the recipient's `default` preference set. Any preferences that are set in both places will keep the value from the recipient's `default` preference set:

    <Image
      src="/images/concepts/preferences/standard-prefs-merge.png"
      alt="A visual of the environment default preferences merging into the recipient's default preferences"
      width={400}
      height={1004}
      className="rounded-md mx-auto border border-gray-200"
    />
    <br />

    The resulting merged preferences will look like this:

    <Image
      src="/images/concepts/preferences/standard-prefs-result.png"
      alt="A visual of the combined environment default and recipient default preference sets after merging"
      width={400}
      height={498}
      className="rounded-md mx-auto border border-gray-200"
    />
    <br />
    The environment-level setting to opt all users into `collaboration` notifications will be respected because the recipient doesn't have an explicit preference for that category, but the recipient's preference to specifically opt in to SMS messages will override the environment-level setting to opt out.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Tenant-specific preference merge hierarchy">
    The following hierarchy is used to merge preferences when a `tenant` is applied to the workflow trigger. Each item in the list takes precedence over the ones that follow it:
    
    1. A recipient's tenant-specific preference set
    2. The tenant's default preference set
    3. The environment-level default preference set

    This merge works in the same way as the standard merge above, but it evaluates different preference sets. Let's take a look at an example to visualize this merge. Suppose that you have the following preference sets:

    <Image
      src="/images/concepts/preferences/tenant-prefs-start.png"
      alt="A visual of the tenant-specific preference sets prior to merging"
      width={400}
      height={1004}
      className="rounded-md mx-auto border border-gray-200"
    />
    <br />
    To visualize the resulting merged preferences, we'll start at the bottom of the hierarchy and move upward—first adding preferences from the environment default to the tenant's default preference set, then adding any of those preferences that are not already present in the recipient's tenant-specific preference set. At each step, if a preference exists in both sets, the value from the higher level in the hierarchy takes precedence:

    <Image
      src="/images/concepts/preferences/tenant-prefs-merge.png"
      alt="A visual of the tenant-specific preferences merging into the tenant's default preferences"
      width={400}
      height={1004}
      className="rounded-md mx-auto border border-gray-200"
    />
    <br />

    The resulting merged preferences will look like this:

    <Image
      src="/images/concepts/preferences/tenant-prefs-result.png"
      alt="A visual of the combined tenant-specific and tenant default preference sets after merging"
      width={400}
      height={498}
      className="rounded-md mx-auto border border-gray-200"
    />
    <br />
    The environment-level settings to opt all users out of SMS messages and into `collaboration` notifications will be respected because neither the tenant nor the recipient have an explicit preference for these items. The tenant's preference to opt users in to `reminders` notifications will be overridden by the recipient's setting to opt out.


    <Callout
      emoji="💡"
      title="Note:"
      text={
        <>
          If a <code>tenant</code> is applied to the workflow trigger but there are no tenant-specific preferences set on the tenant or the recipient, the recipient's <code>default</code> preference set will be evaluated according to the standard merge hierarchy, as if no <code>tenant</code> were applied.
        </>
      }
    />

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

For more information on how you can override these hierarchies, see the [frequently asked questions](#frequently-asked-questions) section below.

## Preference evaluation rules

When a workflow is triggered, Knock will evaluate the preferences for each `recipient` of the workflow and send notifications for each channel step in the workflow based on that evaluation. There are some important rules and caveats to consider:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="General preference rules">
    - If you do not set a preference for a given channel, workflow, or workflow category, Knock defaults them to `true`.
    - When a recipient clicks an unsubscribe link, their `default` preference set will be updated, marking `commercial_unsubscribe` as `true`. They will be opted-out of commercial messages, and they will continue to receive transactional messages based on their other preferences. Read more about commercial unsubscribe [here](/preferences/commercial-unsubscribe).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Resolving preference conflicts">
    Knock only sends a notification if all preference combinations that exist on the recipient evaluate to `true`.

    - A workflow can belong to multiple `categories`. Only one of those category preferences needs to evaluate to `false` for the notification not to send.
    - If a workflow's `category` is set to `false`, the notification will not send even if a `channel_type` on the workflow is explicitly set to `true`.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Debugging preferences">
    Our [Preferences API](/api-reference/recipients/preferences) provides endpoints for retrieving all of the preferences that have been set on a recipient.

    You can also use the [workflow debugger](/send-notifications/debugging-workflows) in your dashboard to view the preferences that were evaluated for the recipient on a given workflow run.

    <Image
      src="/images/concepts/preferences/workflow-preferences-evaluation.png"
      alt="An image of a workflow run's evaluated preferences"
      width={500}
      height={381}
      className="mx-auto rounded-md border border-gray-200"
    />

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Bulk set user preferences

You can update the preferences of up to 1000 users in a single batch by using the `users.bulkSetPreferences` method. This executes an asynchronous job which will overwrite any existing preferences for the users provided. You can track the progress of the `BulkOperation` returned via the [bulk operation API](/api-reference/overview/bulk-endpoints).

<MultiLangCodeBlock
  title="Bulk set preferences for many users"
  snippet="users.bulkSetPreferences"
/>

<br />

## Advanced concepts

- [Per-tenant preferences](/preferences/tenant-preferences). In multi-tenant B2B applications, an advanced use case is customer admins who want to set the tenant-level default `PreferenceSet` for new users within their tenant.
- [Object preferences](/preferences/object-preferences). You can set preferences for object recipients, just as you can for users.
- [Preference conditions](/preferences/preference-conditions). You can build advanced conditions and store them on Knock’s preference model to power use cases such as per-resource muting (example: mute notifications about this task) or threshold alerts (example: only notify me if my account balance is below $5).
- Merge strategy. It's possible to configure the merge strategy on specific preferences within a `PreferenceSet`. This allows you to override the default merge hierarchy when preferences are evaluated. See the [frequently asked questions](#frequently-asked-questions) section below for more details and use cases.
- Workflow overrides. If you need to override a recipient's notification preferences to send notifications like a password reset email, you can override the preferences model. To do this, go to your workflow, click "Manage workflow," and enable "Override recipient preferences." You will need to commit this change for it to take effect. When enabled, the workflow will send to all of its channels, regardless of the recipient's preferences.
- [Commercial unsubscribe](/preferences/commercial-unsubscribe). You can configure 1-click unsubscribe links to help users opt-out of commercial or promotional notifications and comply with CAN-SPAM requirements.

## Frequently asked questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I update a single preference rather than replacing a recipient's entire preference set?">
    Yes. While our preferences API endpoints will default to overwriting the existing `PreferenceSet` with the new preferences provided, it's possible to update a single preference using either of the two options below.
    
    <>
    **1. Setting a `__persistence_strategy__` key on your `PreferenceSet` to `"merge"`**
    </>
    You can provide an optional `__persistence_strategy__` key when providing your `PreferenceSet` to our preferences API endpoints. Setting this key to `"merge"` will perform a deep merge of the provided preferences into any existing preferences. 
    
    Here's what this looks like in practice. If a user has these existing `default` preferences:
    ```json title="An existing default preference set"
    {
      "categories": {
        "collaboration": {
          "channel_types": {
            "email": true,
            "in_app_feed": true
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```
    and they would like to update their email preference for the `collaboration` category to `false`, you can do so by providing the following `PreferenceSet` to our [user preferences endpoint](/api-reference/users/set_preferences):

    ```javascript title="Updating a single preference using the Node SDK"
    import Knock from '@knocklabs/node';

    const client = new Knock({
      apiKey: 'My API Key',
    });

    const preferenceSet = await client.users.setPreferences('user_id', 'default', {
      __persistence_strategy__: 'merge',
      categories: {
        collaboration: {
          channel_types: {
            email: false
          }
        }
      }
    });
    ```

    This will result in the following `PreferenceSet` being set on the recipient:

    ```json title="The resulting default preference set"
    {
      "categories": {
        "collaboration": {
          "channel_types": {
            "email": false,
            "in_app_feed": true
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```
    <br />

    <>
    **2. Inline identifying preferences**
    </>
    You can update a single preference inline by using any of our [recipient identification
    methods](/managing-recipients/identifying-recipients), including while triggering a workflow (as seen in the example below).
    This will perform a deep merge of the provided preferences into any
    existing preferences, just like any other [properties stored on the
    recipient](/concepts/users#storing-user-properties).

    Note that the syntax for providing the `id` of the preference set on an [`InlinePreferenceSetRequest`](/api-reference/recipients/preferences/schemas/inline_preference_set_request)
    is slightly different than the way that our preferences endpoints handles them; you'll simply provide a key-value pair where the key is the `id` of the preference set and the value is the `PreferenceSet` you'd like to merge.

    Here's what this looks like in practice. If a user has these existing `default` preferences:
    ```json title="An existing default preference set"
    {
      "categories": {
        "collaboration": {
          "channel_types": {
            "email": true,
            "in_app_feed": true
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```
    and they would like to update their email preference for the `collaboration` category to `false`, you can do so by providing the following `InlinePreferenceSetRequest` while triggering a workflow:
    ```javascript title="Triggering a workflow with inline preferences using the Node SDK"
    import Knock from "@knocklabs/node";
    const knock = new Knock({ apiKey: process.env.KNOCK_API_KEY });

    await knock.workflows.trigger("new-comment", {
      data: { project_name: "My Project" },
      recipients: [
        {
          id: "1",
          preferences: {
            default: {
              categories: {
                collaboration: {
                  channel_types: {
                    email: false
                  }
                }
              }
            }
          }
        },
      ],
    });
    ```
    This will result in the following `PreferenceSet` being set on the recipient prior to the workflow being triggered:
    ```json title="The resulting default preference set"
    {
      "categories": {
        "collaboration": {
          "channel_types": {
            "email": false,
            "in_app_feed": true
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What is the merge strategy, and how can I use it to override the merge hierarchy?">
    By default, a recipient's individual preferences will always take the highest precedence in the merge when preferences are evaluated (according to the hierarchy outlined under [Merging preferences](#merging-preferences) above).
    
    Some applications have use cases where it's necessary for a preference that is set at the tenant level to override a user's individual preference. For example, you may want to allow a team admin to disable a certain type of notification for their entire team, regardless of whether an individual user has opted in to that notification. To achieve this, you can set the `__strategy__` key on the preference you'd like to override to a value of `"replace"`.

    In the following example, although the user has specifically opted into receiving email notifications for the `collaboration` category, email notifications with that category will not send because the `tenant`'s default preference set has set the `collaboration` category to `false`. Consider the following preference sets:

    ```json title="A user's tenant-specific preference set"
    {
      "categories": {
        "collaboration": {
          "channel_types": {
            "email": true
          }
        },
        "project-updates": {
          "channel_types": {
            "email": true
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    ```json title="The tenant's default preference set"
    {
      "categories": {
        "collaboration": {
          "__strategy__": "replace",
          "channel_types": {
            "email": false
          }
        },
        "project-updates": {
          "channel_types": {
            "email": false
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```
    <br />
    The merge during preference evaluation will look like this:

    <Image
      src="/images/concepts/preferences/replace-prefs-merge.png"
      alt="A visual of the tenant's default preferences merging into the recipient's tenant-specific preferences with the replace strategy applied"
      width={400}
      height={1004}
      className="rounded-md mx-auto border border-gray-200"
    />
    <br />
    The recipient's preference for the `project-updates` category is preserved in the merge, but their preference for `collaboration` notifications is overridden by the tenant's preference due to the `replace` strategy.

    This `replace` strategy will also be reflected when you request the user's preferences via API. Although the user's tenant-specific preferences have explicitly been set to the above, the `__strategy__` key will be present on the `PreferenceSet` returned, indicating that their preference has been overridden by the tenant's:

    ```json title="The returned user preference set"
    {
      "categories": {
        "collaboration": {
          "__strategy__": "replace",
          "channel_types": {
            "email": false
          }
        },
        "project-updates": {
          "channel_types": {
            "email": true
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```
    <br />
    Here are some important thing to keep in mind when using the `replace` strategy:
    - This strategy will only apply to the specific preference(s) where it's included; there's no way to override the entire `PreferenceSet` at the top level.
    - The `__strategy__` key can only be used on a combined `workflows`-`channel_types` or `categories`-`channel_types` preference, as seen in the example above.
    - When the preference with the `replace` strategy is removed, any existing preferences that were overridden by the `replace` strategy will be immediately restored to their original values. For the example above, the user will once again be opted in to `collaboration` notifications.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Why do I see 'channel types' preferences in the workflow debugger even though I didn't set them?">
    In the workflow debugger, Knock will show you the preferences that were evaluated for the recipient on a given workflow run. You may notice `channel_types` preferences, even if you didn't explicitly set them on the recipient or in your environment default preference set.

    This is because Knock automatically opts all recipients in to all `channel_types` by default, to ensure that the recipient receives notifications unless they have been explicitly opted out.

    If you want to override this behavior, you can set the `channel_types` preference to `false` for all channel types in your environment default preference set. This will opt the recipient out from all notifications.
