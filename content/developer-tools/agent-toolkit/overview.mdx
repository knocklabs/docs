description: Use Knock's Agent Toolkit to give your AI agents the ability to send cross-channel messaging, and power rich human-in-the-loop flows.

## Workflows-as-tools

By default the agent toolkit will expose each of your workflows as a tool that your agents can invoke to power cross-channel messaging. Meaning, if you have a workflow (`comment-created`) within your Knock account, the agent toolkit will expose a `trigger_comment_created_workflow` tool that your agents can invoke to send a notification.

Each tool describes the parameters that are required to trigger the workflow, where the parameters for the data payload are read from the [workflow's trigger data JSON schema](/developer-tools/validating-trigger-data). Adding the JSON schema for your workflow trigger data allows the LLM to understand the exact shape and definition of the data payload for the workflow. If the workflow does not specify a trigger data JSON schema, the tool will define a generic data payload for the AI agent to fill in.

You can control this behavior by either turning it off entirely by setting `workflows.read` to `false` or by specifying a list of workflow keys that are allowed to be exposed to the agent (`workflows.read = ["comment-created"]`).
