The Knock agent toolkit allows you to pass context on initialization to automatically scope requests to Knock. This is useful when you're interacting with a single logged in user, or you already know the organization that the agent is interacting with.

## Available context

- `userId`: The user ID of the user that the agent is interacting with.
- `tenantId`: The tenant ID of the organization/workspace/account that the agent is interacting with.

## Setting context

You can set context on the `createToolkit` method.

```typescript
const toolkit = await createToolkit({
  serviceToken: process.env.KNOCK_SERVICE_TOKEN,
  userId: "user_123",
  tenantId: "tenant_123",
});
```

## Where context is used

Once you've set the userId or tenantId context, it will be used to automatically scope requests to Knock. This means that you don't need to pass the userId or tenantId with every request, it will be set automatically.

Many of the tools that the Knock agent toolkit exposes will use the context as a default value, making it possible to omit the this parameter from the LLM's tool call.

For example, when executing a workflow trigger where we have a `userId` set, we can say: `trigger the welcome workflow for the current user` instead of `trigger the welcome workflow for user_123`.

Or, as another example when updating a user's profile, we can say: `update the profile for the current user` instead of `update the profile for user_123`.
