## Installing the Knock agent toolkit

You can install the Knock agent toolkit using npm, yarn, or pnpm.

```bash
npm install @knocklabs/agent-toolkit
```

Once installed you can use the toolkit through the exposed SDK adapters, or if you need low-level access to the toolkit you can use the `@knocklabs/agent-toolkit` package directly.

## Setting up your .env file

You'll need to have a [service token](/developer-tools/service-tokens) setup on your Knock account to authenticate with the Knock Agent Toolkit.

```bash
KNOCK_SERVICE_TOKEN=st_1234567890
```

## Usage with the Vercel AI SDK

```typescript title="Usage with the Vercel AI SDK"
import { createToolkit } from "@knocklabs/agent-toolkit/ai-sdk";

const toolkit = await createKnockToolkit({
  permissions: {
    users: { manage: true },
  },
});

const result = await generateText({
  model: openai("gpt-4o"),
  tools: {
    ...toolkit.getTools("users"),
  },
  maxSteps: 5,
  prompt:
    "Update the current user's profile with information about them, knowing that they are Alan Grant from Jurassic Park. Include custom properties about their favorite dinosaur.",
});
```

## Usage with the OpenAI SDK

```typescript title="Usage with the OpenAI SDK"
import OpenAI from "openai";
import { createToolkit } from "@knocklabs/agent-toolkit/openai";

const toolkit = await createToolkit();

const openai = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY!,
});

const messages = [
  {
    role: "user",
    content:
      "Update the current user's profile with information about them, knowing that they are Alan Grant from Jurassic Park. Include custom properties about their favorite dinosaur.",
  },
];

(async (): Promise<void> => {
  const result = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    model: "gpt-4o",
    messages,
  });

  while (true) {
    const completion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
      model: "gpt-4o",
      messages,
      tools: toolkit.getTools("users"),
    });

    const message = completion.choices[0].message;

    messages.push(message);

    if (message.tool_calls) {
      const toolMessages = await Promise.all(
        message.tool_calls.map((tc) => toolkit.handleToolCall(tc)),
      );
      messages = [...messages, ...toolMessages];
    } else {
      console.log(completion.choices[0].message);
      break;
    }
  }
})();
```

## Usage with the LangChain framework

```typescript title="Usage with the LangChain framework"
import { createToolkit } from "@knocklabs/agent-toolkit/langchain";
import { ChatOpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";
import type { ChatPromptTemplate } from "@langchain/core/prompts";
import { pull } from "langchain/hub";
import { AgentExecutor, createStructuredChatAgent } from "langchain/agents";

const toolkit = await createToolkit();

const llm = new ChatOpenAI({
  model: "gpt-4o",
});

(async (): Promise<void> => {
  const prompt = await pull<ChatPromptTemplate>(
    "hwchase17/structured-chat-agent",
  );

  const tools = toolkit.getTools("users");

  const agent = await createStructuredChatAgent({
    llm,
    tools,
    prompt,
  });

  const agentExecutor = new AgentExecutor({
    agent,
    tools,
  });

  const response = await agentExecutor.invoke({
    input:
      "Update the user's profile with information about them, knowing that they are Alan Grant from Jurassic Park. Include custom properties about their favorite dinosaur.",
  });

  console.log(response);
})();
```
