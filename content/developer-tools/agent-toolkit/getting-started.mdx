## Installing the Knock Agent Toolkit

You can install the Knock Agent Toolkit using npm, yarn, or pnpm.

```bash
npm install @knocklabs/agent-toolkit
```

Once installed you can use the toolkit through the exposed SDK adapters, or if you need low level access to the toolkit you can use the `@knocklabs/agent-toolkit` package directly.

## Setting up your .env file

You'll need to have a [service token](/developer-tools/service-tokens) setup on your Knock account to authenticate with the Knock Agent Toolkit.

```bash
KNOCK_SERVICE_TOKEN=st_1234567890
```
