By default the agent toolkit will expose each of your workflows as a tool that your agents can invoke to power cross-channel messaging. Meaning, if you have a workflow (`comment-created`) within your Knock account, the agent toolkit will expose a `trigger_comment_created_workflow` tool that your agents can invoke to send a notification.

You can think of this as exposing a well-scoped API endpoint that describes exactly how the workflow should be triggered to the LLM/AI Agent. That makes it trivial to build agents that can trigger complex cross-channel messaging flows, with no integration logic.

## Configuring which workflows are exposed as tools

When using the agent toolkit, you can optionally configure exactly which workflows are exposed as tools. To do so, you can set the `permissions.workflows.run` property on the agent toolkit configuration.

In the below example, we're ensuring that **only** the `comment-created`, `task-completed`, and `welcome-user` workflows are exposed as tools to the LLM:

```typescript
const toolkit = createAgentToolkit({
  permissions: {
    workflows: {
      run: ["comment-created", "task-completed", "welcome-user"],
    },
  },
});
```

If you wish to omit exposing any workflows as tools, you can set the `permissions.workflows.run` property to an empty array:

```typescript
const toolkit = createAgentToolkit({
  permissions: { workflows: { run: [] } },
});
```

## Describing the trigger data for each workflow

The trigger data tool created for each workflow exposes the [workflow's trigger data JSON schema](/developer-tools/validating-trigger-data) to the LLM to describe the data payload required to trigger the workflow, and what the shape of that expected data should be.

This allows you to define an explicit contract for your workflow and ensure that the LLM is passing in the correct data when invoking the workflow to send notifications, adding a safe guard so that workflows cannot be triggered with incorrect data supplied.

## Tips for exposing workflows to LLMs

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use the workflow description to add additional calling context for the LLM">
    The workflow description is a great place to add additional calling context
    for the LLM as it is injected into the prompt that exposes the tool. That
    means you can use the description to add additional calling context, like
    when the workflow should be used, or what the context of the workflow is.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Limit the workflows that are exposed to the LLM">
    It's best if you limit the workflows exposed to the LLM as tools to only
    those that you absolutely know that the LLM can trigger. This helps keep the
    LLM "focussed" on the task, and sticks to best practice about the total
    number of tools available.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Ensure your trigger data JSON schema has good descriptions">
    The trigger data JSON schema is a great place to add descriptions to the
    fields of the data payload. This helps the LLM understand the data payload
    and fill it in accurately.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Keep your trigger data JSON schema as simple as possible">
    Although the LLM can fill in the trigger data for the workflow, it's best to
    keep the trigger data JSON schema as simple as possible to aid with
    accuracy.

## Example prompts for triggering workflows

Here are some example prompts for invoking your workflows as tools in your AI Agent:

- "Trigger the comment-created workflow for the current user."
- "When the task completes, notify the user using the task-completed workflow."
- "Send all of the users in the engineering team a welcome message using the welcome-user workflow."
