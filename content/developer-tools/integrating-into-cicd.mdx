With the [Knock CLI](/developer-tools/knock-cli), you can add Knock directly into your existing CI/CD pipeline in order to automate the promotion of changes to Workflows, Layouts, Partials, and Translations between [environments](/concepts/environments) during testing and deployment.

This guide assumes that you have [created](/concepts/environments#create-additional-environments) a “Staging” environment in Knock in addition to the Development and Production environments that are provided by default. It also assumes that you have [installed the Knock CLI](/cli/overview/installation) on your local machine.

## Local development

With the Knock CLI, you can pull all of your resources from the Knock dashboard and develop them locally using the [`knock pull`](/cli/pull) command. If you’d prefer to pull each type of resource individually, you can use one of the following commands:

- [`knock workflow pull --all`](/cli/workflow/pull)
- [`knock layout pull --all`](/cli/email-layout/pull)
- [`knock partial pull --all`](/cli/partial/pull)
- [`knock translation pull --all`](/cli/translation/pull)

You can also work with specific resources by providing a `key` rather than using the `--all` flag.

Once you’re ready to send your updates back to Knock’s Development environment, you can push ([`knock push`](/cli/push)) and commit ([`knock commit`](/cli/commit/all)) changes directly from the command line in the same way that you would save and commit them in your dashboard. You can also perform both of these actions at once by using the `--commit` flag on any `push` command.

      As with working directly in your dashboard, any uncommitted changes that
      are made to a Knock resource and pushed to Knock can be overwritten by
      another user who is working on the same resource. It’s important to{" "}
      <code>commit</code> any changes that you want to persist while working in
      the Development environment.
    </>
  }

## Pushing to your remote repository and deploying to staging

When you’re ready to commit your locally-developed feature (including any updates to your Knock resources) to a remote git repository and kick off a test build in your staging environment, you can use the Knock CLI to automate the promotion of changes to your Knock resources across Knock environments. An example implementation might be done with a GitHub Action that promotes all of your committed updates from the Knock Development environment to your Staging environment, so that your application’s staging deployment will have access to all of your notifications changes.

      When using the <code>knock commit promote</code>{" "}
      <a href="/cli#commit-promote">command</a> with the <code>--to</code> flag,
      the CLI will automatically locate any promotion-eligible changes that
      exist in the environment one "level" lower in your list of Knock
      environments in order to promote them to the designated environment. To
      view the current order of all your configured environments, navigate to{" "}
      <span className="font-bold">Settings &gt; Environments</span> in your
      Knock dashboard.
    </>
  }
/>

This sample GitHub Action `.yaml` file shows how you might promote all committed changes from your Development environment to your Staging environment:

```yaml
name: Knock Workflow Promotion to Staging

on:
  push:
    branches-ignore:
      - main

jobs:
  promote_workflow:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: "20.9.0" # Set Node.js version to ^16.14.0

      - name: Install Knock CLI
        run: npm install -g @knocklabs/cli

      - name: Promote Workflow to Staging
        env:
          KNOCK_SERVICE_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.KNOCK_SERVICE_TOKEN }} # Ensure you've set KNOCK_SERVICE_TOKEN in your GitHub secrets
        run: knock commit promote --to=staging --service-token=$KNOCK_SERVICE_TOKEN
```

## Deploying to production

Once a pull request has been approved and is ready to be merged into your `main` branch, you can once again include the Knock CLI in your CI/CD pipeline to promote your relevant Knock resources to your Production environment.

This sample GitHub Action `.yaml` file shows how you might promote all changes from your Staging environment to your Production environment:

```yaml
name: Knock Workflow Promotion to Production

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  promote_workflow:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: "20.9.0" # Set Node.js version to ^16.14.0

      - name: Install Knock CLI
        run: npm install -g @knocklabs/cli

      - name: Promote Workflow to Production
        env:
          KNOCK_SERVICE_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.KNOCK_SERVICE_TOKEN }} # Ensure you've set KNOCK_SERVICE_TOKEN in your GitHub secrets
        run: knock commit promote --to=production --service-token=$KNOCK_SERVICE_TOKEN
```
