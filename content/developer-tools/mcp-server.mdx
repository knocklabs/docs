      <strong>Note</strong>: the MCP server is currently in beta. Due to the
      non-deterministic nature of LLMs it's recommended that you test running
      the MCP against resources in your development environment before running
      it in production.

Knock ships an MCP server that exposes the primitives of Knock to LLMs and AI via the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) so that your AI agents can discover and use Knock via tool calling.

Here are some examples of how you can use the MCP server in your workflow:

- Create workflows using natural language ("create me a welcome email workflow for my B2B SaaS app")
- Trigger a specific workflow to test your integration ("trigger the comment-created workflow for dnedry")
- Create a set of test user and tenant data in your account ("create a user called dnedry and a tenant called acme-corp")

## Get started

To get started with the MCP server, you'll need to create a [service token](/developer-tools/service-tokens) to use to authenticate against your Knock account. You can do so under the "Settings" > "Service tokens" page in the Knock dashboard.

## Configuring the available tools

It's not recommended to expose all tools that the Knock MCP server has to the LLM. Instead, you should expose only the tools that are required to complete the task at hand. You can configure the available tools by passing in the `--tools` flag when starting the MCP server.

Here are some examples of how you can configure the available tools:

- Expose all tools: `--tools *`
- Expose all user tools: `--tools users.*`
- Expose only the `users.create` tool: `--tools users.create`

## Workflows-as-tools

The Knock MCP server also supports exposing your workflows as individual tools. This allows you to provide a specific and precise interface to the LLM for invoking workflow triggers, including describing the data trigger requirements for your workflows. By default, the MCP server will **not** expose any workflows-as-tools. To opt into this behavior, you can pass in the `--workflows` flag when starting the MCP server.

By default, passing the `--workflows` flag will expose **all** workflows in your Knock account as tools. If you want to control the exact workflows that are exposed as tools, you can pass a list of workflow keys to the `--workflows` flag. For example:

```bash
--workflows "workflow-key-1,workflow-key-2"
```

## What tools are available?

The MCP server ships with tools to interact with all Knock resources. You can find the list of available tools in the [Knock Agent Toolkit](/developer-tools/agent-toolkit/overview) documentation.

Please note: at the time of writing, the MCP server **does not** ship with any tools to delete resources. This is intentional to prevent the accidental deletion of resources in your Knock account.

  <Accordion title="Do you support a remote MCP server?">
    No, currently we support a local MCP server only. We are, however, working
    on a remote MCP server so that an individual Knock account can be
    authenticated.
