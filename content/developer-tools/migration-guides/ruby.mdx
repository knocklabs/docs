title: Ruby SDK upgrade (v0.x to v1.0)
description: Learn how to upgrade to v1.0 of the Knock Ruby SDK.
section: Developer tools

## Basic changes

### Client initialization

Initialize a client instance with your API key:

```ruby title="Initializing the Knock client"
require "knockapi"

# Initialize a client instance
knock = Knockapi::Client.new(
  api_key: "sk_12345" # defaults to ENV["KNOCK_API_KEY"]
)
```

## What's new in v1.0

The v1.0 SDK brings strong typing with Sorbet, auto-pagination, and enhanced error handling to the Ruby ecosystem.

### Strong typing with Sorbet

Improved type definitions for better IDE integration.

### Auto-pagination

Iterate through paginated resources automatically:

```ruby title="Auto-pagination through user list"
# Automatically fetches more pages as needed.
page = knock.users.list
page.auto_paging_each do |user|
  puts user.id
end
```

### Enhanced error handling

Handle errors more effectively with improved error classes:

```ruby title="Handling API errors with specific classes"
begin
  user = knock.users.get("dnedry")
rescue Knockapi::Errors::APIError => e
  puts e.status # 400
end
```

### Configurable timeouts and retries

Fine-tune request behavior by customizing timeouts and retry limits:

```ruby title="Configuring timeouts and retries"
knock = Knockapi::Client.new(
  timeout: 20, # 20 seconds (default is 60)
  max_retries: 3 # default is 2
)
```

### New resources

Work with additional resources like [Audiences](/concepts/audiences), [Channels](http://localhost:3002/concepts/channels), and [Integrations](/integrations/sources/overview):

```ruby title="Working with audience resources"
# Working with audiences
knock.audiences.add_members(
  "audience-id",
  members: ["user-1", "user-2"]
)
```

### Request options

More control over individual requests:

```ruby title="Setting per-request options"
knock.users.get("dnedry", request_options: { timeout: 5 })
```

## Breaking changes

### Client design

The new SDK uses an instance-based client rather than module functions. Create a client instance with `knock = Knockapi::Client.new()` and call methods via the client: `knock.workflows.trigger()` instead of `Knock::Workflows.trigger()`.

### Method naming and organization

The main module is now `Knockapi` instead of `Knock`.

Bulk operations are now organized in their own namespaces: `knock.users.bulk.*`, `knock.objects.bulk.*`, `knock.schedules.bulk.*`, etc.

Several method names have changed:

- `Knock::Users.identify()` is now `knock.users.update()`
- `Knock::Users.set_preferences()` is now `knock.recipients.preferences.set()`
- `Knock::Users.get_channel_data()` is now `knock.recipients.channel_data.get()`
- `Knock::Users.getSchedules()` is now `knock.users.listSchedules()`
- `Knock::Workflows.createSchedules()` is now `knock.schedules.create()`
- `Knock::Workflows.listSchedules()` is now `knock.schedules.list()`
- `Knock::Workflows.updateSchedules()` is now `knock.schedules.update()`
- `Knock::Workflows.deleteSchedules()` is now `knock.schedules.delete()`

### Method parameters

Most methods now take the ID(s) as positional parameter(s), followed by named parameters. Resource IDs moved from named parameters to positional parameters (e.g., `id: "user-1"` is now `"user-1"`). `data:` parameters have been flattened in most methods.

### Preference management

Preferences are now handled through the `recipients.preferences` module. The preference set ID must be explicitly provided (usually "default").

### Response handling

The new SDK returns model instances rather than raw hashes. Pagination is handled via cursor-based pagination instead of page-based.

## Common operations

### Triggering workflows

**Old SDK:**

```ruby title="Triggering workflows with the old SDK"
Knock::Workflows.trigger(
  key: "dinosaurs-loose",
  actor: "dnedry",
  recipients: ["jhammond", "agrant"],
  data: {
    type: "trex",
    priority: 1,
  },
  cancellation_key: trigger_alert.id,
)
```

**New SDK:**

```ruby title="Triggering workflows with the new SDK"
knock.workflows.trigger(
  "dinosaurs-loose",
  recipients: ["jhammond", "agrant"],
  actor: "dnedry",
  data: {
    type: "trex",
    priority: 1,
  },
  cancellation_key: trigger_alert.id,
)
```

### Identifying users

**Old SDK:**

```ruby title="Identifying users with the old SDK"
Knock::Users.identify(
  id: "jhammond",
  data: {
    name: "John Hammond",
    email: "jhammond@ingen.net",
  }
)
```

**New SDK:**

```ruby title="Identifying users with the new SDK"
knock.users.update(
  "jhammond",
  name: "John Hammond",
  email: "jhammond@ingen.net"
)
```

### Working with preferences

**Old SDK:**

```ruby title="Setting user preferences with the old SDK"
Knock::Users.set_preferences(
  user_id: "jhammond",
  channel_types: { email: true, sms: false },
  workflows: {
    'dinosaurs-loose': {
      channel_types: { email: false, in_app_feed: false }
    }
  }
)
```

**New SDK:**

```ruby title="Setting user preferences with the new SDK"
knock.recipients.preferences.set(
  "users", "jhammond", "default",
  channel_types: { email: true, sms: false },
  workflows: {
    'dinosaurs-loose': {
      channel_types: { email: false, in_app_feed: false }
    }
  }
)
```
