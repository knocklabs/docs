The Knock CLI helps you build, test, and manage your Knock notification system, right from the terminal. You can use the CLI to:

- Pull Knock workflows down to your local machine and work with your notification logic and templates in your code editor.
- [Integrate Knock into your CI/CD pipeline](/developer-tools/integrating-into-cicd) and automatically promote changes between Knock environments on release.
- Map your translation files into Knock to localize your notifications.

## Installing the CLI

You can install the Knock CLI using `npm`, a node package manager, with the following command:

```bash title="Installing the Knock CLI"
npm install -g @knocklabs/cli
```

Once the CLI is installed, you can call it by using the `knock` command in your terminal. The CLI is also available via Homebrew for macOS. See [the installation documentation](/cli/overview/installation).

## Authenticating the CLI

The Knock CLI relies on [service tokens](/developer-tools/service-tokens) in order to authenticate against your Knock account.

Once you have generated a service token, you can verify it works by running `knock whoami --service-token=YOUR_SERVICE_TOKEN`. If your token is valid and configured properly, you'll receive a 200 response that shows the account name and the service token name.

## CLI reference

You can find a complete reference for all of the commands and flags available on the [CLI in our comprehensive reference](/cli).
