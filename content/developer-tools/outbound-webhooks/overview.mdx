Use outbound webhooks to be notified of events happening within your Knock environment, and respond to those events in realtime in your product.

## An overview of webhooks

Knock can send a JSON payload to your backend with data about events that occur within Knock, like a message's status changing from `sent` to `delivered`. You can configure an endpoint and select which events you'd like it to listen to. When that event happens you'll get a POST request to the endpoint you've provided and then can use that data to trigger side-effects in your app.

You can learn more about the types of events that [Knock sends webhooks for here](/developer-tools/outbound-webhooks/event-types).

## Quickstart

1. [Create an endpoint in your app to receive webhook requests](#1-create-an-endpoint-to-receive-the-webhook-payload) and respond to requests with a `200` or `204` status code
2. [Create a webhook in the Knock dashboard](#2-create-the-knock-webhook) pointing to your endpoint
3. Start receiving webhook events!

## Payload & headers

A webhook payload will always take the following base shape, where the `type` and its associated `data` schema will be determined by the supported [webhook event types](/developer-tools/outbound-webhooks/event-types). The `data` field will include the entity that the event references.

```json title="A sample event payload"
{
  "__typename": "Event",
  // The type of event that triggered the webhook
  "type": "message.sent",
  "created_at": "2022-05-31T17:12:59.958652Z",
  "data": {
    // Information about the entity, as determined by the webhook event type.
  },
  // (Optional) additional metadata related to the event
  "event_data": {
    "__typename": "EventData",
    "foo": "bar"
  }
}
```

The request header will also contain the following:

- `x-knock-event`: the field and the value found in the `"type"` key of the payload
- `x-knock-environment-id`: the environment the webhook belongs to
- `x-knock-signature`: the encoded result of a timestamp, payload, and shared secret key so you can verify that the contents of the webhook are from Knock and not a result of a [Man in the middle attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack).

      When you create a webhook, it will be for the environment you're currently
      in. If you'd like to add that webhook to another environment, you'll have
      to create it again there. What this means is that when you create a
      webhook in a development environment, it will only be triggered by
      notifications from workflows in development.

## How to create a webhook

### 1. Create an endpoint to receive the webhook payload

In your app, create an endpoint specifically to receive incoming requests from a webhook you'll set up in Knock. This must be an HTTP or HTTPS endpoint on your server with a URL. This is where Knock will send a request with data about events you'll select in the next step. Keep in mind that you can use one webhook endpoint per event type, or you can send multiple types of events to the same endpoint.

#### Retries

Knock webhooks have built-in retries for `3xx`, `4xx`, and `5xx` responses from your endpoint. Make sure to send a `2xx` (i.e. `200`) response from your endpoint once you've received the webhook request before operating on the data to avoid a timeout, which will result in the webhook being retried. **It will attempt to send the webhook 8 times before it discards the message.** You can track the webhooks sent in the webhook delivery logs, as detailed in the [managing webhooks](#reading-webhook-delivery-logs) section below.

### 2. Create the Knock webhook

You can create a new webhook by navigating to `Webhooks` in the Knock dashboard. You can find this in the sidebar under `Platform`.

When you click "Create webhook" you'll be prompted to add the endpoint from the previous step, an optional description, and then select the events you want to be notified of from the list.

Once you create the webhook, it will be activated and you will begin receiving requests to your endpoint. To stop receiving requests, you can [delete the webhook](#deleting-a-webhook).

## Receiving a webhook payload

### IP addresses for firewall whitelisting

If your infrastructure uses a firewall that restricts incoming traffic by IP address, you can whitelist the following Knock IP addresses to ensure webhook deliveries:

- `3.138.92.104`
- `18.116.161.231`
- `3.19.195.170`

### Verifying the signature

We recommend that upon receiving the webhook request you verify the signature before using the contents of the payload. We follow the Stripe specification to add a layer of security to our webhook requests.

The signature is generated with a HMAC using the SHA256 algorithm and, prior to being encoded, is comprised of the timestamp and the stringified JSON payload of the request. We encode `"timestamp in numerical form"."stringified payload"` as the signature of the request.

The `x-knock-signature` header is a string comprised of the timestamp used in the encoding and the encoded value above. It will look like this: `t=timestamp,s=encoded-signature`

To test that the payload sent has not been compromised, you can recreate the signature using the shared secret key found on the Webhook page and compare to the one sent in the header.

1. Split the `x-knock-signature` on the comma (",") and extract the values of timestamp and signature.
2. Construct the value of the signature by concatenating:

   - The timestamp (as a string)
   - The character `.`
   - The stringified JSON payload

3. Generate the signature with an HMAC and SHA256 algorithm using the secret key from your webhook's dashboard
4. Compare your generated signature with the one extracted in step one; they should match exactly. If the timestamp is more than five minutes old compared to the current time, you may decide you want to reject the payload for additional security.

Here's an example to follow:

```javascript title="Validating a webhook payload with your secret key"
// This example uses Express to receive webhooks
const express = require("express");
const crypto = require("crypto");

const app = express();

// Find your webhook's secret key on its page in your Knock dashboard
const webhookSecret = "some-secret";

// Match the raw body to content type application/json
app.post(
  "/webhook",
  express.raw({ type: "application/json" }),
  (request, response) => {
    const sig = request.headers["x-knock-signature"];

    // Extract the timestamp and signature from the header and remove the identifiers
    const timestamp = sig.split(",")[0].substring(2);
    const originalSignature = sig.split(",")[1].substring(2);
    // Construct the value to be encoded (stringify the body)
    const value = `${timestamp}.${JSON.stringify(request.body)}`;

    // Generate the signature with a HMAC using the SHA256 algorithm
    const reconstructedSignature = crypto
      .createHmac("sha256", webhookSecret)
      .update(value)
      .digest("base64");

    // Compare the signature from the header with your reconstructed signature to validate
    const isValid = crypto.timingSafeEqual(
      Buffer.from(originalSignature, "utf-8"),
      Buffer.from(reconstructedSignature, "utf-8"),
    );

    // For additional security, validate that the timestamp is within your
    // tolerance for proximity to the current time (example shown within 5 minutes)
    const date = new Date(parseInt(timestamp, 10));
    const now = Date.now();
    const isWithinFiveMinutes = Math.abs(now - date.getTime()) < 300000;

    if (isValid && isWithinFiveMinutes) {
      response.json({ received: true });
    } else {
      response.status(400).send("Webhook Error, invalid signature");
    }
  },
);

app.listen(4242, () => console.log("Running on port 4242"));
```

### Using the data

Once you receive a webhook request and return a `2xx` status code, you can make additional requests to the Knock API to gather more information about the event. For example, if you're building a webhook for the `message.undelivered` event, and you'd like to log the message's content, you can use the message ID to send a request to [get message content](/api-reference/messages/get_content) when that event is received.

## Managing webhooks

### Reading webhook delivery logs

<Callout
  emoji="⚠️"
  title="Data subject to retention policy enforcement."
  text={
    <>
      See the{" "}
      <a href="/manage-your-account/data-retention">data retention docs</a> for
      more details on how Knock enforces this policy.
    </>
  }
/>

When you visit a webhook's page, if it has begun to send data to your endpoint you'll see a log for every POST request. This will give you the following information:

- **Status code:** your server's response to the webhook request
- **Event type:** the type of event it was reporting on
- **Timestamp:** when the event was sent to your endpoint

You'll see details about each log as well. When you select a log, you'll be able to see the **full request payload** sent to your endpoint.

You'll also see if your endpoint has stopped working as it will display a `4xx` or `5xx` status code for undelivered webhooks.

### Disabling a webhook

When you create a webhook it will automatically be set to `enabled`. You can disable it by going to the webhook's page, and toggling the status to `disabled`. This means that it will not trigger any webhook requests when an event it is configured to listen to is fired. When you're ready to start receiving requests again, toggle the status back to `enabled`.

### Deleting a webhook

To stop receiving data to your endpoint, you can delete the webhook from its page. From `/webhooks`, click on the webhook you'd like to delete and you'll see a three-dot menu to the right of the header. Click there and you'll see the delete prompt. Keep in mind that if you delete a webhook, you'll have to recreate it to start receiving data to that endpoint again.
