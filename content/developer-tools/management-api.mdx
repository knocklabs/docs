The Knock management API provides you with a programmatic way to interact with the resources you create and manage in your Knock dashboard, including workflows, templates, and translations. It's separate from the [Knock API](/reference) and only provides access to a limited subset of resources.

You can use the Knock management API to:

- Create, update, and manage your Knock workflows and the notification templates within those workflows.
- Create, update and manage your [email layouts](/integrations/email/layouts).
- Create and manage the [translations](/send-and-manage-data/translations) used by your notification templates.
- Create, update, and manage your [partials](/designing-workflows/partials).
- Commit and promote changes between your Knock environments.

## Interacting with the management API

Currently, we do not ship SDKs that wrap the management API but we do ship a [CLI](/developer-tools/knock-cli) for easily interacting with the resources in your Knock account.

## Use cases

### Previewing templates

Using the management API, you can generate previews of the templates within your workflows. One example use case is providing a way for your users to customize the content of notifications sent through Knock.

To preview a template, you [use the preview template endpoint exposed by the management API](/mapi#workflows-preview-template). This API endpoint accepts a workflow key, and a step reference for the step that contains the template you want to preview.

Using the endpoint, you pass through details about the `recipient`, `actor`, `tenant`, and any other data variables that are used within the template. The endpoint will return a JSON object with fully rendered template generated using the data you provided, just like if you're previewing the template in the Knock dashboard.

```bash title="An example request to preview a template"
curl -X POST https://control.knock.com/v1/workflows/my-workflow/steps/my-step/preview_template \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SERVICE_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"recipient": "chris", "data": {"project_name": "My Project"}}'
```

<br />

```json title="An example response from the preview template endpoint"
{
  "result": "success",
  "content_type": "email",
  "template": {
    "html_content": "<html><body><p>Hello world!</p></body></html>",
    "text_content": "Hello world!",
    "subject": "Hello, world!"
  }
}
```
