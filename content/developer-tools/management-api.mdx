The Knock management API provides you with a programmatic way to interact with the resources you create and manage in your Knock dashboard, including workflows, templates, and translations. It's separate from the [Knock API](/reference) and only provides access to a limited subset of resources.

You can use the Knock management API to:

- Create, update, and manage your Knock workflows and the notification templates within those workflows.
- Create and manage the [translations](/send-and-manage-data/translations) used by your notification templates.
- Commit and promote changes between your Knock environments.

## Interacting with the management API

Currently, we do not ship SDKs that wrap the management API but we do ship a [CLI](/developer-tools/knock-cli) for easily interacting with the resources in your Knock account.
