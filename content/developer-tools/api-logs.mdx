Knock automatically captures and stores all of the API requests you make to the Knock API, and makes these requests accessible under the **Developers** > **Logs** section of the left-hand navigation in the Knock dashboard.

## Filtering API logs

You can filter API logs in your Knock account using the following filters:

- **Request ID**: filter for a particular log returned by the `X-Request-ID` header.
- **Status**: filter for failed and succeeded requests.
- **Endpoint type**: filter for requests to particular sets of endpoints.
