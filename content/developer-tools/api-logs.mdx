Knock automatically captures and stores all of the API requests you make to the Knock API, and makes these requests accessible under the **Developers** > **Logs** section of the left-hand navigation in the Knock dashboard.

## Filtering API logs

You can filter API logs in your Knock account using the following filters:

- **Request ID**: filter for a particular log returned by the `X-Request-ID` header.
- **Status**: filter for failed and succeeded requests.
- **Endpoint type**: filter for requests to particular sets of endpoints.

## Log truncation

Knock truncates logs with long binaries, lists, and maps to prevent the logs from becoming too large. The truncation is done at the top level of the JSON object, and the truncation is indicated by the presence of the `__knock_truncated__` key in the JSON object.

Knock does not store response bodies for the `/feeds` endpoint.
