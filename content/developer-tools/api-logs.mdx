Knock automatically captures and stores all of the API requests you make to the Knock API, and makes these requests accessible under the **Developers** > **Logs** section of the Knock dashboard.

## Filtering API logs

You can filter API logs in your Knock account using the following filters:

- **Request ID**: filter for a particular log returned by the `X-Request-ID` header.
- **Status**: filter for failed and succeeded requests.
- **Endpoint type**: filter for requests to particular sets of endpoints.

## Log truncation

Knock truncates logs with long binaries, lists, maps, and strings to prevent the logs from becoming too large. The truncation occurs at the top level of the JSON object and is noted by the presence of either the `__knock_truncated__` key in the JSON object (indicating that some of the keys were dropped) or as a `[TRUNCATED]` value under a given key.

```json title="Example of a truncated log"
// Original JSON object with many keys
{
  "foo": "bar",
  "biz": "this is a very long string value",
  "baz": null,
  ...
}

// Truncated JSON object
{
  // indicates that some of the key-value pairs were dropped
  "__knock_truncated__": true,
  "foo": "bar",
  "biz": "[TRUNCATED]"
}
```
