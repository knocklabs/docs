## SSO configuration

To configure SAML SSO, an **account owner** will need to complete the following steps:

1. Log in to your Knock dashboard
2. Navigate to **Settings** > **Security**
3. In the Security section, locate the "Single Sign-On (SSO)" panel
4. Click on the "Connect SSO provider" button to begin the configuration process. This will launch our SAML SSO configuration wizard where you can select and configure your identity provider.

After completing the steps of the configuration walkthrough, SAML will be successfully configured for your account.
This will allow users with emails under your domain to be able to log in successfully through the provider you
have configured.

      domain as your own. If your setup requires support for more than one
      domain, contact support.

## SSO authentication

Once SAML SSO is configured on your account, all members will be required to log in using the provider you
configured. When visiting the login screen, users must use the email field to start the authentication flow.
Users will **not be allowed to authenticate** using other authentication methods while SAML SSO is enabled on your account.
