## Overview

You can set a default timezone for your account by navigating to the **General** page under your account settings and selecting a timezone. If no timezone is selected, the default timezone is UTC.

## When the account timezone is used

Knock uses the account timezone when a workflow evaluates time-based behavior and the recipient doesn't have a timezone set. This includes:

- **[Send windows](/designing-workflows/send-windows)**: Evaluates allowed send periods.
- **[Schedules](/concepts/schedules)**: Calculates next run times.
- **[Batch steps](/designing-workflows/batch-function)**: Determines when time-based batching windows open and close.
- **[Delay steps](/designing-workflows/delay-function)**: Resolves `delay_until` to a specific time.
- **[Throttle steps](/designing-workflows/throttle-function)**: Determines when time-based throttle windows reset.
