## Overview

You can set a default timezone for your account by navigating to the **General** page under your account settings and selecting a timezone. If no timezone is selected, the default timezone is UTC.

## When the account timezone is used

The account timezone will be used as a fallback for [send windows](/designing-workflows/send-windows) and [schedules](/concepts/schedules) if the recipient does not have a timezone set.

Additionally, the account timezone is relevant for workflow steps that may need to evaluate timezone-based logic depending on their configuration:

- **[Batch steps](/designing-workflows/batch-function)**: When using time-based batching windows, the timezone determines when batch windows open and close.
- **[Delay steps](/designing-workflows/delay-function)**: When using `delay_until` with a specific time, the timezone determines when the delay expires.
- **[Throttle steps](/designing-workflows/throttle-function)**: When using time-based throttle windows, the timezone determines when throttle windows reset.
