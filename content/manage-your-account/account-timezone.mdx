## Overview

You can set a default timezone for your account by navigating to the **General** page under your account settings and selecting a timezone.

The account timezone will be used as a fallback for [send windows](/designing-workflows/send-windows) and [schedules](/concepts/schedules) if the recipient does not have a timezone set.
