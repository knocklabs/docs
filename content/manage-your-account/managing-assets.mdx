## Overview

Assets are files that you upload to Knock for use in your notification templates. You can upload images to be hosted by Knock and reference them via URL in your templates. This is useful for including logos, icons, and other visual elements in your notifications.

Account owners, admins, and members can manage assets from the **Assets** page in the Knock dashboard's settings.

## Uploading assets

To upload a new asset:

1. Navigate to **Settings** in the Knock dashboard.
2. Select the **Assets** page.
3. Click the "Upload" button.
4. Select an image file from your computer.

### File requirements

Keep the following requirements in mind when uploading assets:

- **File size.** Each image must be 2 MB or less.
- **File type.** Currently, only image files are supported (e.g., PNG, JPEG, GIF, SVG).

You can upload as many images as you need to your Knock account.

## Using assets in templates

Once you've uploaded an asset, you can copy its URL and use it in your notification templates. To copy the URL:

1. Navigate to **Settings > Assets** in the Knock dashboard.
2. Find the asset you want to use.
3. Click the copy button to copy the asset URL to your clipboard.

You can then paste this URL into your notification templates wherever you need to reference the image, such as in email templates or in-app notifications.

## Deleting assets

To delete an asset:

1. Navigate to **Settings > Assets** in the Knock dashboard.
2. Find the asset you want to delete.
3. Click the delete button to remove the asset.

      reference an asset before deleting it.
