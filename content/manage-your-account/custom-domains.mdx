Knock supports setting up custom domains for your account to use for [link tracking](/send-notifications/tracking#how-it-works) (including short links in SMS and WhatsApp) and [email open tracking](/send-notifications/tracking#email-open-tracking).

Setting a custom domain is important for deliverability and branding. You run the risk of having your messages marked as spam if the sending domain and the domain you're routing to for links are different.

By default, Knock uses [a variety of domains](/send-notifications/tracking#link-click-tracking-domains) for link tracking, short links in SMS and WhatsApp, and email open tracking. These domains are shared across all accounts and are not configurable. Custom domains enable you to override these defaults and use your own domains.

## Setting up a custom domain

<Callout
  type="info"
  title=""
  text={
    <>
      We recommend using a subdomain of an existing domain with established
      email reputation (e.g., <code>link.yourcompany.com</code>) as a custom
      domain. If using a brand new domain, consider warming it first to build
      reputation and avoid deliverability issues.
    </>
  }
/>

To set up a custom domain, you can navigate to the **Custom domains** page under the **Account** section of your account settings in your Knock dashboard and click the "Add domain" button.

You'll be prompted to enter the domain you want to use, for example `link.yourcompany.com`. From here, you will need to set DNS records for the domain to verify it.

### Setting DNS records

You'll need to add a CNAME record to your DNS configuration for the domain to verify it. The CNAME record should point to `cname.knock.app`. Here are some examples for common providers:

- [Cloudflare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/manage-dns-records/how-to/create-dns-records/)
- [Google Cloud DNS](https://docs.cloud.google.com/dns/docs/set-up-dns-records-domain-name)
- [Route 53](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/resource-record-sets-editing.html)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs/domains/managing-dns-records)
- [GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com/help/add-a-cname-record-19236)

Once set, you can click the "Verify domain" button to verify the domain and that the DNS records are pointing to the correct value. Please note that it can take up to 48 hours for the DNS changes to propagate.

Once a domain is verified, you can set how the domain will be used and the environments to which it is applied.

## Selecting where a custom domain is used

To select where a custom domain is used, choose the relevant option from the list of use cases and click "Apply and activate."

- **Link tracking.** These are links used for tracking link clicks within your notifications. Link tracking is used across many different channels, including email, in-app feed, SMS, and WhatsApp.
- **Short links.** These are links used for generating short links in SMS and WhatsApp messages.
- **Open tracking.** These are links used for generating a 1x1 transparent tracking pixel, currently used only within email notifications.

## Assigning a custom domain to an environment

Custom domains are assigned to one or more [environments](/concepts/environments). This means that you can easily assign the same custom domain to multiple environments, or you can use different custom domains for different environments for testing purposes.

To assign a custom domain to an environment, you can simply select the environment from the list of environments and click the "Apply and activate" button.

## Rolling out your custom domains

<Callout
  type="warning"
  title="Test your custom domains before rolling them out to production."
  text={
    <>
      We strongly advise that you test out your custom domains in a
      non-production environment before rolling them out to your production
      environment.
    </>
  }
/>

When you're ready to roll out your custom domains to production, you can simply assign the custom domain to your production environment and you're good to go. The changes will take effect immediately, and any future messages sent will use the custom domain for generated links and open tracking.

## Frequently asked questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="I've added the CNAME record successfully. Why isn't my domain marked as verified?">
    Please check that the CNAME record is pointing to the correct value. You can
    also try to verify the domain again by clicking the "Verify domain" button.
    It can take up to 48 hours for DNS changes on your domain to propagate. If after 48
    hours the domain is still not verified, please reach out to our support
    team at
    [support@knock.app](mailto:support@knock.app?subject=Custom%20domain%20verification%20issue).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I use a brand new domain?">
    Yes, you can use a brand new domain. However, we recommend that you warm up
    the domain before using it for production traffic so that it has a good
    reputation.
