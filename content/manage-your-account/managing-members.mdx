## Overview

People with access to your Knock account are called members. Each member has a [role](/manage-your-account/roles-and-permissions) that determines what they can do in your account. With appropriate permissions, members can access the **Members** page in your Knock dashboard settings. You can use this page to invite, manage, and remove members from your account.

## Adding members

### Inviting members

You can invite new members to your account by selecting the "New member" button on the **Members** page. Members are always invited via their email address and must be assigned [a role](/manage-your-account/roles-and-permissions). You can optionally include a message that will appear in the invitation email.

The member will be sent a reminder email if the invite is not accepted within 3 days. Account invites will automatically expire after 2 weeks.

### Managing invitations

Once you invite a user to your Knock account, their invitation appears as a "pending invite" on the **Members** page until they accept. You can revoke pending invitations, which marks the invite as invalid and expires it immediately.

Once you revoke an invitation for a user, you can reinvite them by following the same "New member" process. This will generate a new invitation for the user to join your account.

### Enabling auto-join

You can enable auto-join on your account to let users that belong to your domain automatically join your account when signing up for Knock. This is helpful for cases where people from your organization sign up for Knock on their own without realizing your account already exists.

You can enable auto-join on the **Security** page under the **Admin** section of your account settings in your Knock dashboard.

/>

When you enable auto-join, you'll need to select which domains can auto-join your account. For security reasons, we only let you select non-public domains that belong to the owners of your account.

This means that you cannot enable auto-join for public domains (such as gmail.com). Additionally, before you can add a new domain to auto-join, someone with an email address from that domain must have an [owner role](/manage-your-account/roles-and-permissions) on your account.

<Callout
  type="alert"
  title="Note:"
  text={
    <>
      All users that join through auto-join will receive the <code>member</code>{" "}
      role by default. If you have a user from your domain you want to invite with a role other
        than <code>member</code>, just send them an invite as you normally
        would. We prioritize the role assigned on an invitation over the
        auto-join default.
    </>

## Managing members

### Updating member roles

Account members with appropriate [permissions](/manage-your-account/roles-and-permissions) can update the roles of others by selecting "Change role" from the three-dot menu. The role change will take effect immediately.

### Removing members

Members with appropriate [permissions](/manage-your-account/roles-and-permissions) can remove other members from an account by clicking the "Remove member" option found in the three-dot menu. Removing a member will revoke their access to Knock and immediately invalidate any session associated with the member. The removed member will receive an email informing them of the change in account access.

<Callout
  type="info"
  title="Note:"
  text={
    <>
      Users can't change their own roles or remove themselves from a Knock
      account and accounts must have at least one <code>owner</code> at all
      times.
