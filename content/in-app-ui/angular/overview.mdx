Today we do not have Knock-built, out-of-the-box Angular components for in-app notifications UI.

Our Knock community built this [Angular in-app feed example](https://github.com/knocklabs/angular-in-app-feed-example) you can use to get started with an Angular in-app feed in your own application.

If you have any questions, or if you have an in-app use case that is blocking your adoption of Knock, please [contact our sales team](sales@knock.app).
