Knock uses two different concepts to power in-app messaging: feeds and guides. While feeds enable you to build notification centers and inboxes with messages generated ahead of time, guides enable you to power in-product UI with content and targeting managed in the Knock dashboard. In this document we'll cover the key differences between the two, and when to use each.

## Feeds

The [feeds API](/api-reference/users/feeds) enables you to build notification feeds, inboxes, and notification centers that display a chronological list of per-user notifications.

Feed messages are generated ahead of render time by triggering workflows or scheduling broadcasts. When a user opens their feed, the API fetches pre-generated messages and displays them.

### Feed characteristics

- Returns a list of messages generated ahead of time by triggering workflows and scheduling broadcasts.
- Returns messages in reverse chronological order.
- Returns aggregate values for unread counts, read counts, and seen counts, for use in feed badge UIs.
- Can be filtered by status (unread, read, seen, archived) or custom properties.

### Feed use cases

- When you want to build a notification feed, inbox, or notification center.
- When you want to build a notification experience that can be thought of as a list of items.

## Guides

The [guides API](/api-reference/users/guides/) enables you to power in-product messaging using your own UI components. Use guides for announcements, upgrade flows, paywalls, banners, and other UI that doesn't fit the feed-based model.

Guides are data-driven and evaluated at render time. When a user is eligible to see a guide based on targeting and activation rules configured in the Knock dashboard, the API returns the guide data to your application. Your engineering team controls the UI layer, while your content team manages content, targeting, and activation rules in the dashboard.

### Guides characteristics

- Returns guides based on eligibility determined by [targeting conditions](/in-app-ui/guides/create-guides#targeting) and [activation location rules](/in-app-ui/guides/create-guides#activation).
- Can fetch a guide by its unique `key` or fetch guides filtered by `type` (message type).
- Does not include aggregate counts of unseen/unread items.
- Generates messages when a guide is fetched and returned to a user.

### Guides use cases

- When you need eligibility determined at runtime based on user attributes or application state.
- When you want to control the UI layer in your codebase while non-technical teams manage content and targeting.
- When you need location-based activation rules (showing UI on specific pages or routes).
- For non-feed UI such as modals, banners, tooltips, badges, or inline components like paywalls.
