Knock uses two different concepts to power in-app messaging: feeds and guides.

In this document we'll cover the key differences between the two, and when to use each.

## Feeds

The [feeds API](/api-reference/users/feeds) is great for building in-product messaging that relies on a _feed_ of per-user notifications.

The key unique principle of the feeds API relative to guides is that feed messages must be generated ahead of render time. If you consider the UX of a notification feed or inbox, it makes sense. The user opens the feed, the feed fetches the messages, and the messages are rendered.

Here are a few characteristics of the feeds API.

- Returns a list of messages generated ahead of time by triggering workflows and scheduling broadcasts.
- Returns messages in reverse chronological order.
- Returns aggregate values for unread counts, read counts, and seen counts, for use in feed badge UIs.
- Can be filtered by status (unread, read, seen, archived) or custom properties.

When to use feeds:

- When you want to build a notification feed or inbox or notification center.
- When you want to build a notification experience that can be thought of as a list of items.

## Guides

The [guides API](/api-reference/users/guides/) is great for building in-product messaging that doesn't fit well into the feed-based model, such as announcements, paywalls, and other one-time or evergreen UI.

The key unique principle of the guides API is that messages are generated at render time. This means that instead of pre-generating a message using a workflow or a broadcast, guides are generated when a user in your frontend is eligible to see a particular guide. When a guide renders to a user, Knock generates a message on the backend for analytics and observability purposes.

Here are a few characteristics of the guides API:

- Returns either a single guide with a `key` or a list of guides that all share a `message-type`
- Does not include aggregate counts of unseen/unread items

When to use guides:

- For non-feed use cases such as modals, banners, tooltips, and inline components such as paywalls or other UI.
