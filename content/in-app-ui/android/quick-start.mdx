The Knock Kotlin SDK is a client-side SDK for interacting with the Knock API and for building in-app notification experiences for Android applications. In this guide, we'll show some of the main ways you can interact with the SDK.

**Quick links**

## Installing the SDK

Add the dependency to your `build.grandle` file as follows:

```java
dependencies {
    implementation 'app.knock.client:knock:VERSION'
}
```

Or to your `maven.xml` file:

```xml
<dependencies>
    <!-- more dependencies here -->
    <dependency>
        <groupId>app.knock.client</groupId>
        <artifactId>knock</artifactId>
        <version>VERSION</version>
    </dependency>
    <!-- more dependencies here -->
</dependencies>
```

## Using the SDK

You must authenticate the SDK using your publishable key (prefixed by `pk_`) and the user ID to make requests against.

```kotlin
var knockClient = Knock(publishableKey: "your-pk", userId: "user-id")

// with enhanced security turned on:
var knockClient = Knock(publishableKey: "your-pk", userId: "user-id", userToken: "your-user-token")
```
