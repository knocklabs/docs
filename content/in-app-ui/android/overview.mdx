The Knock Android SDK is a low-level set of methods for interacting with the Knock APIs from Android applications. The SDK is designed to help you easily integrate Knock into your application and build in-app notification experiences powered by Knock.

## Features

- API methods for interacting with the [Knock in-app API](/in-app-ui/api-overview).
- Managed websocket connections to the Knock real-time service.

## Getting started

### 1. Add Jitpack repository support in your `settings.gradle` file

```gradle
pluginManagement {
    repositories {
        ...
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}

dependencyResolutionManagement {
    repositories {
        ...
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}
```

### 2. Add the implementation to your app `build.gradle` file

```gradleâ€ƒ

dependencies {
    implementation 'com.github.knocklabs:knock-android:<VERSION>'
}
```
