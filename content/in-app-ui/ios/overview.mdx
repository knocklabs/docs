Our Swift SDK library lets you create notification experiences using Knock's APIs. It comes with pre-built UI components that you can use to easily get up and running with a fully functional notification feed experience in your product.

## Getting started

Please reference our iOS SDK [documentation](https://docs.knock.app/sdks/ios/quick-start) to setup the library.

## Pre-built components

The Knock React SDK ships the following pre-built UI elements:

### In-app notifications

- [`InAppFeedView`](https://docs.knock.app/in-app-ui/ios/components#knockinappfeedview): A full-page list of notifications.
- [`InAppFeedViewController`](https://docs.knock.app/in-app-ui/ios/components#knockinappfeedview): A wrapper for InAppFeedView to be used with UIKit.
- [`InAppFeedViewModel`](https://docs.knock.app/in-app-ui/sdks/ios/reference#knockinappfeedviewmodel): All of the logic needed to support your in-app feed. Can be used independently from `InAppFeedView` if you want to build your own UI.
- [`InAppFeedNotificationIconButton`](https://docs.knock.app/in-app-ui/ios/components#inappfeednotificationiconbutton): For adding a bell icon to your application that shows the current count of unread or unseen notifications.
