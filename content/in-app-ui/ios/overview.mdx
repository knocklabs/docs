Our Swift SDK library lets you create notification experiences using Knock's APIs. It comes with pre-built UI components that you can use to easily get up and running with a fully functional notification feed experience in your product.

## Getting started

Please reference our iOS SDK [documentation](/sdks/ios/quick-start) to set up the library.

## Pre-built components

The Knock iOS SDK ships the following pre-built UI elements:

### In-app notifications

- [`InAppFeedView`](/in-app-ui/ios/components#knockinappfeedview): A full-page list of notifications.
- [`InAppFeedViewController`](/in-app-ui/ios/components#knockinappfeedview): A wrapper for InAppFeedView to be used with UIKit.
- [`InAppFeedViewModel`](/in-app-ui/ios/components#knockinappfeedviewmodel): All of the logic needed to support your in-app feed. Can be used independently from `InAppFeedView` if you want to build your own UI.
- [`InAppFeedNotificationIconButton`](/in-app-ui/ios/components#inappfeednotificationiconbutton): For adding a bell icon to your application that shows the current count of unread or unseen notifications.
