The Knock iOS SDK is a low-level set of methods for interacting with the Knock APIs from iOS applications. The SDK is designed to help you easily integrate Knock into your application and build in-app notification experiences powered by Knock.

## Features

- API methods for interacting with the [Knock in-app API](/in-app-ui/api-overview).
- Managed websocket connections to the Knock real-time service.

## Getting started

You can install the Swift SDK in a few different ways:

- Swift Package Manager (SPM)
- Cartage
- Cocoapods

### Installing via Swift Package Manager

You can add the package by pointing to the Github repo: `https://github.com/knocklabs/knock-swift.git`.

### Installing via Carthage

Add `github "knocklabs/knock-swift" ~> 0.1.0` to your Cartfile.

Follow the steps listed in the [README here](https://github.com/knocklabs/knock-swift#carthage).

### Installing via Cocoapods

Add the dependency to your Podfile:

```
platform :ios, '16.0'
use_frameworks!

target 'MyApp' do
  pod 'Knock', '~> 0.1.0'
end
```
