The Knock Swift SDK is a client-side SDK for interacting with the Knock API and for building in-app notification experiences across iOS, macOS, and watchOS.

**Quick links**

- [SDK on Github](https://github.com/knocklabs/knock-swift)
- [Full reference guide](/in-app-ui/ios/reference)

## Example app

You can find a complete iOS example application that uses the Swift SDK [here](https://github.com/knocklabs/ios-example-app). The app shows patterns for handling push token registration, building an in-app feed using SwiftUI, and managing user notification preferences.

## Need help?

Our Swift SDK is worked on full-time by the Knock Swift team.
