The Knock Swift SDK is a client-side SDK for interacting with the Knock API and for building in-app notification experiences across iOS, macOS, and watchOS. In this guide, we'll show some of the main ways you can interact with the SDK.

**Quick links**

- [SDK on Github](https://github.com/knocklabs/knock-swift)
- [Full reference guide](/in-app-ui/ios/reference)

## Getting started

To use this example, you'll need [an account on Knock](https://dashboard.knock.app), as well as an in-app feed channel with a workflow that produces in-app feed messages. You'll also need:

- A public API key for the Knock environment (which you'll use in the `publishableKey`)
- The channel ID for the in-app feed (which you'll use in `feedId`)

## Installation

You can install the Swift SDK in a few different ways:

- Swift Package Manager (SPM)
- Cartage
- Cocoapods

### Installing via Swift Package Manager

You can add the package by pointing to the Github repo: `https://github.com/knocklabs/knock-swift.git`.

### Installing via Carthage

Add `github "knocklabs/knock-swift" ~> 0.1.0` to your Cartfile.

Follow the steps listed in the [README here](https://github.com/knocklabs/knock-swift#carthage).

### Installing via Cocoapods

Add the dependency to your Podfile:

```
platform :ios, '16.0'
use_frameworks!

target 'MyApp' do
  pod 'Knock', '~> 0.1.0'
end
```

## Using the SDK

You must authenticate the SDK using your publishable key (prefixed by `pk_`) and the user ID to make requests against.

```swift
import Knock

knockClient = try! Knock(publishableKey: "your-pk", userId: "user-id")

// with enhanced security turned on:
knockClient = try! Knock(publishableKey: "your-pk", userId: "user-id", userToken: "signed-user-token")
```
