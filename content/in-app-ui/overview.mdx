## Overview

In addition to delivering to out-of-app channels such as email, push, SMS, and chat apps like Slack, you can also use Knock to build great in-app messaging experiences.

You can power any kind of in-app message with Knock, whether itâ€™s transactional messages such as in-app feeds, notification centers, or toasts, or lifecycle-based messages such as banners, modals, or tags.

Knock enables you to deliver these in-app messages to your users **in your own native product UI**, while the **content** of those messages is drafted from the Knock dashboard.

Knock also provides an orchestration layer to determine **who** receives those messages, **when** they receive them, and **where** in your product those messages are rendered.

Knock differs from other customer messaging platforms by separating the **content and presentation** of in-app messages, all while providing the orchestration engine and infrastructure to deliver them.

## Feeds and guides

Knock supports two different types of in-app channel depending on the experience you're looking to build.

- [Feeds](/in-app-ui/feeds/overview). A type of in-app channel that returns a per-user list of in-app messages to render in a feed-based UI.
- [Guides](/in-app-ui/guides/overview). A type of in-app channel that renders a single in-app message to a user when they visit a specific page in your application.

You can learn more about the difference between feeds and guides in our [feeds vs guides](/in-app-ui/feeds-vs-guides) overview.

## Why build in-app experiences on Knock?

- **Real-time ready.** Our in-app API comes ready with websocket support, no infrastructure setup required.
- **No data modeling required.** We handle all of the common cases for you: accurate badge counts, polymorphic notifications, read, seen and archive tracking, and much more.
- **Build holistic experiences.** Use the Knock workflow builder to create cross-channel notification experiences to power cases like "send to the in-app feed, if they don't see the feed message within 5 minutes then fallback to sending an email."
- **Complete APIs that are easy to use.** We take all of the heavy lifting out of building APIs to support common in-app notification experiences, like preferences and feeds.
- **Drop-in components.** We have components ready to help you get started with building in-app notification experiences in React.
- **Fully customizable.** It's easy to customize the experience by overriding styles, components, or building your own headless UI using our lower-level primitives.

## Client SDKs available

We have the following SDKs available to use to build in-app notification experiences:

- [React (Web)](/in-app-ui/react/overview)
- [JS (Non-React Web)](/in-app-ui/javascript/overview)
- [React Native](/in-app-ui/react-native/overview)
- [Swift (iOS / macOS)](/in-app-ui/ios/overview)
- [Kotlin (Android)](/in-app-ui/android/overview)
- [Flutter (Android/iOS)](/in-app-ui/flutter/overview)

Under each client SDK, you'll find documentation to help you get started.

## Going to production

You'll need to follow our checklist on [going to production](/tutorials/implementation-guide#going-to-production) for any in-app notifications using Knock. Most importantly you'll need to [secure your requests to the Knock API for each user](/in-app-ui/security-and-authentication).
