Our [`knock_flutter`](https://pub.dev/packages/knock_flutter) library lets you create in-app notification experiences in Flutter applications using Knock's client APIs.

**Quick links:**

- [`knock_flutter` on pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/knock_flutter)
- [Example application using the Flutter SDK](https://github.com/knocklabs/knock-flutter/tree/main/example)
- [Full reference](/in-app-ui/flutter/reference)

Using the Flutter SDK it's possible to:

- Integrate push notifications
- Build in-app experiences, like [feeds](/in-app-ui/flutter/notification-feeds) that update in real-time
- Create notification preference control centers
