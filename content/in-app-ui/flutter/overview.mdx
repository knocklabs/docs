The Knock Flutter SDK is a low-level set of methods for interacting with the Knock APIs from Flutter applications. The SDK is designed to help you easily integrate Knock into your application and build in-app notification experiences powered by Knock.

## Features

- API methods for interacting with the [Knock in-app API](/in-app-ui/api-overview).
- Managed websocket connections to the Knock real-time service.
- State management for powering in-app feeds, with optimistic client-side updates.

## Getting started

```bash
flutter pub add knock_flutter
```
