Our [`knock_flutter`](https://pub.dev/packages/knock_flutter) library lets you create in-app notification experiences in Flutter applications using Knock's client APIs.

**Quick links:**

- [`knock_flutter` on pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/knock_flutter)

Using the Flutter SDK it's possible to:

- Integrate push notifications (manual engagement status handling required)
- Build in-app experiences, like feeds that update in real-time
- Create notification preference control centers
