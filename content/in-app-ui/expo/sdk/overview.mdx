Our [`@knocklabs/expo`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@knocklabs/expo) library lets you create in-app notification experiences using Knock's client APIs in applications built with React Native and Expo.

<Callout
  type="info"
  title="Not using Expo?"
  text={
    <>
      See our{" "}
      <a href="/in-app-ui/react-native/sdk/overview">React Native SDK</a>. Our
      Expo SDK is only meant for use with React Native apps that are built with
      Expo.
    </>
  }
/>

The Expo library is built on top of the `@knocklabs/client` JS SDK and includes that library as an implicit dependency.

### Installation

```bash title="Installing dependencies"
npm install @knocklabs/expo
```

<Callout
  emoji="ℹ️"
  title="Version compatibility."
  text="The @knocklabs/expo package is compatible with Expo version 53 and above."
/>

### Configuration

To configure the feed you will need:

1. A public API key (found in the Knock dashboard)
2. A user ID and an auth token

   <Callout
  type="info"
     title="Note:"
     text={
       <>
         Auth tokens are strongly recommended for production environments and
         are required when enhanced security mode is enabled. For more
         information, see our{" "}
         <a href="/in-app-ui/security-and-authentication#authentication-with-enhanced-security">
           Security & Authentication documentation
         </a>
         .
       </>
     }
   />

3. If integrating an in-app feed, a feed channel ID (found in the Knock dashboard)

### Usage

You can integrate the feed into your app as follows:

```typescript
import {
  KnockProvider,
  KnockFeedProvider,
  NotificationFeed,
} from "@knocklabs/expo";

const YourAppLayout = () => {
  return (
    <KnockProvider
      apiKey={process.env.KNOCK_PUBLIC_API_KEY}
      user={{ id: userId }}
    >
      {/* Optionally, use the KnockFeedProvider to connect an in-app feed */}
      <KnockFeedProvider feedId={process.env.KNOCK_FEED_ID}>
        <NotificationFeed
          onRowTap={(item) => {
            console.log("Notification tapped:", item);
          }}
        />
      </KnockFeedProvider>
    </KnockProvider>
  );
};
```

### Headless usage

Alternatively, if you don't want to use our components you can render the feed in a headless mode using our hooks:

```typescript
import {
  useAuthenticatedKnockClient,
  useNotifications,
  useNotificationStore,
} from "@knocklabs/expo";

const YourAppLayout = () => {
  const knockClient = useAuthenticatedKnockClient(
    process.env.KNOCK_PUBLIC_API_KEY,
    { id: currentUser.id },
  );

  const notificationFeed = useNotifications(
    knockClient,
    process.env.KNOCK_FEED_ID,
  );

  const { metadata } = useNotificationStore(notificationFeed);

  useEffect(() => {
    notificationFeed.fetch();
  }, [notificationFeed]);

  return <Text>Total unread: {metadata.unread_count}</Text>;
};
```

Using the Expo SDK it's possible to build:

- [Notification feeds](/in-app-ui/react-native/notification-feeds) that update in real time
- Notification preference control centers
- Push notification management

## Example app

Our [Expo SDK example app](https://github.com/knocklabs/javascript/tree/main/examples/expo-example) shows patterns for handling push token registration, building an in-app feed, and managing user notification preferences.
