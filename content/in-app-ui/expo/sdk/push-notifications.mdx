title: "Handling Push Notifications with React Native and Expo"
description: A guide on integrating Expo push notifications with the Knock SDK in your React Native application.
section: SDKs
---

**Note:** This guide assumes you're utilizing our `KnockExpoPushNotificationProvider` for a streamlined push notification setup within your React Native and Expo environment.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the integration process, ensure your Knock account is set up for push notifications. For initial setup instructions, please visit our [Push Notification Configuration Guide](/integrations/push/overview).

<Steps titleSize="h2">

<Step title="Setting Up Push Notifications with Expo">

1. **Create a Push Notification Channel in Knock:**

   - Log in to your Knock account and navigate to the **Integrations** > **Channels** section of the dashboard.
   - Create a new channel with type `Expo Push Notifications` and note the channel ID.

2. **Install Expo Dependencies:**
   - `expo": "~50.0.14`
   - `expo-constants": "^15.4.0`
   - `expo-device": "^5.9.3`
   - `expo-notifications": "^0.27.6`

</Step>

<Step title="Registering for Push Notifications">

1. **Wrap Your App with `KnockExpoPushNotificationProvider`:**
   - Ensure your app is wrapped with `KnockProvider` and then `KnockExpoPushNotificationProvider`, passing the Expo channel ID from Knock.

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { View } from "react-native";
import {
  KnockProvider,
  KnockExpoPushNotificationProvider,
} from "@knocklabs/expo";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <KnockProvider
      apiKey="{YOUR_KNOCK_PUBLIC_API_KEY}"
      user={{ id: "{YOUR_USER_ID}" }}
    >
      <KnockExpoPushNotificationProvider knockExpoChannelId="{YOUR_KNOCK_EXPO_CHANNEL_ID}">
        <View> {/* Your app content here */} </View>
      </KnockExpoPushNotificationProvider>
    </KnockProvider>
  );
}
```

2. **Initiate Registration in Your Component:**
   - The `KnockExpoPushNotificationProvider` automatically registers for push notifications.
   - If you want to manually register, utilize the `useExpoPushNotifications` hook:

```jsx
import React, { useEffect } from "react";
import { Text } from "react-native";
import { useExpoPushNotifications } from "@knocklabs/expo";

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { expoPushToken, registerForPushNotifications } =
    useExpoPushNotifications();

  useEffect(() => {
    registerForPushNotifications();
  }, []);

  return <Text>Your Expo Push Token: {expoPushToken}</Text>;
};
```

</Step>

<Step title="Handling Incoming Push Notifications">

The `KnockExpoPushNotificationProvider` automatically handles receiving and tapping on notifications. To customize this behavior:

1. **Custom Notification Handling:**
   - Use the `onNotificationReceived` and `onNotificationTapped` methods from the `useExpoPushNotifications` hook to set custom handlers.

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  onNotificationReceived((notification) => {
    console.log("Notification received:", notification);
  });

  onNotificationTapped((response) => {
    console.log("Notification tapped:", response);
  });
}, []);
```

</Step>

<Step title="Sending Test Notifications">

Use the Knock dashboard or API to send a test notification to ensure your setup is correct. Verify that the notification appears on your device and that tapping on it triggers the expected behavior.

</Step>

</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

- **Not Receiving Notifications:** Ensure your Expo push token is correctly registered with Knock and that your device's notification settings allow push notifications from your app.
- **Handling Silent Notifications:** If implementing silent notifications, ensure that your notification payload is correctly configured to not display an alert or sound.
