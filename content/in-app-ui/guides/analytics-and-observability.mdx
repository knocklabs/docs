Knock provides comprehensive analytics and observability features for guides, enabling you to track user engagement, monitor guide performance, and understand how your in-product messaging is performing across your application.

## Guide analytics overview

  className="rounded-md mx-auto border border-gray-200"
/>

Each guide page includes an analytics summary that highlights key metrics over the last N days, based on your account's [retention period](/manage-your-account/data-retention). These metrics are based on the [engagement events tracked for the guide](/in-app-ui/guides/handling-engagement).

The key metrics available include:

- **Audience**. The total number of users in the target audience for this guide.
- **Seen**. The number of users for whom this guide is marked as seen.
- **Interacted**. The number of users who interacted with this guide.
- **Archived**. The number of users who archived or dismissed this guide.

## Guide message status

Guide analytics measure user interaction based on message status. You'll interact with a set of [engagement status](/send-notifications/message-statuses#engagement-status) options to track user interaction. When using Knock's pre-built components, these message status events will be handled automatically, but you also have the option to map these statuses to your own internal meanings to make your guides analytics useful for your team.

The available engagement tracking options for guides include:

- **Seen**. The guide was rendered and visible to the user.
- **Interacted**. The user took an action within the guide (clicked a button, link, etc.).
- **Archived**. The user dismissed or archived the guide. This action removes the guide from eligibility for that user.

These statuses help you understand the effectiveness of your guides and identify opportunities for optimization.

## Accessing guide analytics

### Knock dashboard

You can view guide analytics directly in the Knock dashboard:

1. Navigate to **Guides** in your environment.
2. Select the guide you want to review.
3. View the analytics summary in the guide details panel.

You can also view analytics across all guides in the **Observability** > **Analytics** section, where you can filter and group by guide key to compare performance across different guides.

### API

You can access guide metrics programmatically using the [Guides API](/api-reference/users/guides). This enables you to work with guide message data and gives you flexibility to build custom dashboards and integrate guide metrics into your existing analytics tools.

## Message logs

You can access message details for guides through the **Messages** tab of each guide in the Knock dashboard, or via **Observability** > **Messages**. In the messages table, you can identify:

- **Engagement status**. Current engagement state (seen, archived, etc.) per recipient.
- **Recipient information**. Which users received the guide and when.
- **Message timeline**. Creation and engagement timestamps for each guide message.

## Data export

Guide message events are included in Knock's [available integrations](/integrations/extensions/overview) with analytics platforms, enabling you to track guide engagement alongside your other product data.

Customers using [data warehouse sync](/integrations/extensions/data-sync), can also access guide analytics data in the exported messages table. Guides messages can be identified by the presence of a `guide_id` and `guide_key`, which allows you to filter and analyze guide-specific message data in your data warehouse.
