In this document you'll learn how to create a guide in the Knock dashboard.

## Overview

A guide is created in the Knock dashboard under the "Guides" page. Guides have:

- **Content.** The template of the guide. When you create your template, you select a [message type](/in-app-ui/message-types) which defines the schema of the content to be authored in a guide.
- **Targeting rules.** Configuration rules for determining which users in your application are eligible to see a guide. Targeting rules are built with the standard Knock condition builder. You can target based on audience membership, user properties, tenant properties, and more. Defaults to "All users".
- **Activation rules.** Configuration rules for determining where in your application the guide is rendered.

Here are some other important things to know about guides:

- **Guides are version controlled.** Just like workflows, guides follow our [versioning model](/concepts/commits). That means changes are made in your `development` environment and are promoted to `production`.
- **Guides depend on message types**. A [message type](/in-app-ui/message-types) defines the _schema_ of the content to be authored in a guide. You can think of a message type as the structure of the component, defining which fields are available.
- **Guides can have personalized content**. Just like workflow templates, you can personalize the contents of a guide message using Liquid.
- **Guides can be managed by anyone with the owner, admin, or member permission.**

## Runtime data and personalization/targeting

Guides can receive runtime data from your application via the [guides API](/api-reference/users/guides/). You can use this data to personalize the guide's content and set its targeting rules.

- `recipient`. The current user that is requesting the guide. The full user object, including any custom properties, is available in the rendering scope.
- `data`. Any custom data provided from the client to the guides API.
- `tenant`. The full tenant object if provided to the guides API.
- `vars`. Any [variables](/concepts/variables) available in your Knock environment.

## Drafting content

Creating the content for a guide is just like creating an in-app message template elsewhere in Knock. You select your message type, its variant, and then use the fields available to you to draft your content.

    margin: "0 auto",
    border: "1px solid #e5e7eb",
    display: "block",
  }}
/>

When creating your template content, you can make personalizations using [Liquid](/designing-workflows/template-editor/overview) and any [data passed to the guides API](/guides#overview) at runtime, including `data`, `recipient`, `tenant`, and `vars` properties.

All existing [liquid filters and functions](/designing-workflows/template-editor/reference-liquid-helpers) are available in the guide template, including the ability to use translations via the `t` tag and `t` filter.

## Targeting

You can currently target guides to:

- All users (no targeting)
- A user within a specific [audience](/concepts/audiences)

It's also possible to specify targeting conditions which can further limit who is eligible for the guide using Knock's [condition model](/concepts/conditions). You can use conditions to target any [data passed to the guides API](/guides#overview) at runtime, including `data`, `recipient`, and `tenant` properties.

## Activation

A guide is activated when it is rendered to the user in your application. You can optionally configure activation rules that determine where in your application a guide should be rendered.

Today activation rules are limited to path-based rules, which means you can target a guide to only render on certain pages in your application.

If you do not provide any activation rules, the guide will activate when you call the `useGuide` hook in your application. Read more about rendering guides [here](/in-app-ui/guides/render-guides).

    margin: "0 auto",
    border: "1px solid #e5e7eb",
    display: "block",
  }}
/>

## Enabling and disabling guides

You can stop serving a guide immediately to all your customers by toggling the "Active" status in each environment. Making the status "Inactive" will immediately stop any guides being displayed to users.
