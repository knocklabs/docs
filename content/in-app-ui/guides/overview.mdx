## Overview

A guide represents a piece of UI that you want to be **powered by Knock within your application**.

  width={1356}
  height={1452}
  className="rounded-md mx-auto border border-gray-200"
/>

You configure your guide in the Knock dashboard, including its **content**, its **targeting** rules (who can see it), and its **activation** rules (where in your product they can see it.)

You then use our API and client SDKs to render the **data** of a guide within your application.

Your engineering team owns the UI layer, and your content team owns the contents of the UI shown to users. Knock seamlessly powers this on your behalf, making it effortless to build powerful, managed UI components that any one in your team can maintain.

## Use cases

- **Upgrade flows.** Show a guide to users on a `free` plan to display an upgrade button.
- **Outage banners.** Show a guides to all customers when there's upcoming maintenance for your product.
- **In-place feature announcements.** Ship static pieces of UI that prompt a user to learn more about new features.
- **Welcome modals.** Display a welcome modal to new users to help them get started with your product.

## Benefits

Using Knock guides to power your application UI gives you:

- **Native performance.** Guides render as first-class React, Vue, or Angular components instead of injected scripts. They add no runtime overhead and stay aligned with your design system.
- **Composable primitives for engineers.** The package ships components, hooks, low-level APIs, and socket infrastructure you can assemble into any in-product announcement, UI, or tour.
- **Self-service for product and marketing.** Content, targeting, and activation rules are edited entirely in the dashboard; no code or deploys required.
- **Built-in analytics and observability.** Delivery and engagement events are tracked automatically and can be forwarded to the analytics destinations you already use, whether that's a data warehouse, a third-party analytics service, or your own custom analytics platform.
