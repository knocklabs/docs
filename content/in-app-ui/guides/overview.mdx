## Overview

A guide represents a piece of UI that you want to be **powered by Knock within your application**.

<div style={{ position: "relative", paddingBottom: "56.25%", height: 0 }}>
  <iframe
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lKYfB3FYMtk?si=VFbtG8BqXpa8m3PS"
    frameBorder="0"
    allowFullScreen
    style={{
      position: "absolute",
      top: 0,
      left: 0,
      width: "100%",
      height: "100%",
    }}
  />
</div>

You configure your guide in the Knock dashboard, including its **content**, its **targeting** rules (who can see it), and its **activation** rules (where in your product they can see it.)

You then use our API and client SDKs to render the **data** of a guide within your application.

Your engineering team owns the UI layer, and your content team owns the contents of the UI shown to users. Knock seamlessly powers this on your behalf, making it effortless to build powerful, managed UI components that anyone on your team can maintain.

## Use cases

- **Upgrade flows.** Show a guide to users on a `free` plan to display an upgrade button.
- **Outage banners.** Show a guides to all customers when there's upcoming maintenance for your product.
- **In-place feature announcements.** Ship static pieces of UI that prompt a user to learn more about new features.
- **Welcome modals.** Display a welcome modal to new users to help them get started with your product.

## Benefits

Using Knock guides to power your application UI gives you:

- **Native performance.** Guides render as first-class React, Vue, or Angular components instead of injected scripts. They add no runtime overhead and stay aligned with your design system.
- **Composable primitives for engineers.** The package ships components, hooks, low-level APIs, and socket infrastructure you can assemble into any in-product announcement, UI, or tour.
- **Self-service for product and marketing.** Content, targeting, and activation rules are edited entirely in the dashboard; no code or deploys required.
- **Built-in analytics and observability.** Delivery and engagement events are tracked automatically and can be forwarded to the analytics destinations you already use, whether that's a data warehouse, a third-party analytics service, or your own custom analytics platform.

## Frequently asked questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How does pricing for Guides work?">
    Guides uses a monthly engaged users (MEU) pricing model. This is the
    distinct number of users who have **seen** or **engaged** with a guide in
    the billing period.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="I'm already an Enterprise customer. Do I need to pay for guides separately?">
    If you don't already have Knock guides included in your enterprise
    agreement, you'll have the same guides limit as our Starter plan: 2,500
    active users a month. When you exceed that limit, we'll ask you to get in
    touch to add guides to your enterprise agreement.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I use guides in my cross-channel workflows and broadcasts?">
    Users are made eligible for guides based on their audience membership and
    targeting rules. To bring guides into your workflows, you can use our fetch
    step to add a user to an audience. We'll be adding support for an
    out-of-the-box "Update user" step in the future to make this more turnkey.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Is guide eligibility recalculated in real-time?">
    No, right now if your user enters an audience their guide eligibility will
    not be recalculated. Instead, you must either wait for the next guide fetch
    or manually trigger a refetch of the guides.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I pass application state to guides to use in targeting and personalization?">
    Yes, you can pass an arbitrary dictionary of data from your application to
    the guides API which can be used to determine eligibility as well as used in
    guide personalization.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I power multi-step product tours with guides?">
    Not as of our initial release. We're working on this and if you're
    interested we'd love to hear your use case at
    [support@knock.app](mailto:support@knock.app?subject=Guides%20beta%20feedback).
