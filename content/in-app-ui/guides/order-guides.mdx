In this document you'll learn how to prioritize guides by ordering them in the Knock dashboard.

## Overview

When multiple guides are eligible to be shown to a user at the same time, Knock uses ordering rules to determine which guide takes priority. In addition, you can also configure throttle settings to control how frequently guides are displayed to users. Together they enable you to control the user experience and ensure the most important guides are shown first without overwhelming your users.

Guide ordering and throttling are essential for:

- **Preventing guide collisions.** Ensuring users aren't overwhelmed by multiple guides appearing simultaneously
- **Prioritizing important content.** Making sure critical announcements or onboarding flows take precedence
- **Managing content sequence.** Controlling the sequence of educational content or feature announcements
- **Creating better user experiences.** Delivering content in a logical order and at a pace that makes sense for your users

## How guide ordering works

When selecting guides using the `useGuide` or `useGuides` hooks (or via the guide client directly), by default the oldest created guides are returned first before the most recently created ones.

You can change this behavior by manually ordering them in the Knock dashboard into a display sequence of which guides are shown first.

Note: guide order is set in each environment independently and not subject to Knock's version control system. Therefore, changing the order will take effect immediately upon saving it.

### Setting guide order

You can set the order of a guide in the Knock dashboard:

<Steps titleSize="h3">
  <Step title="Navigate to your guide">
    Go to the Guides page in your Knock dashboard.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open guide settings">
    Click on the "Edit order" button in the top right corner.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set the order value">
    While in "Edit order" mode, drag and drop guides to re-order them. Guides that are positioned higher toward the top will be shown first to users.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save your changes">
    Click the "Save order" button to apply the new order.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Guide throttling

To prevent overwhelming users with too many guides in a short period, consider implementing throttle settings to space out how often guides are shown to users.

By default, guides are throttled to be shown one at a time to users, and dismissing a guide would lead to showing the next guide immediately.

You can change this behavior by configuring throttle settings to delay showing the next guide by waiting for a certain duration. (e.g. "show 1 guide every X mins/hours/days")

Note: similar to guide order, throttle settings is set in each environment independently and not subject to Knock's version control system. Saving changes will take effect immediately.

### Setting throttle settings

<Steps titleSize="h3">
  <Step title="Navigate to your guide">
    Go to the Guides page in your Knock dashboard.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open guide settings">
    Click on the "Throttle: .." button in the top right corner.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set the order value">
    Set a display interval by its value and unit. Clear out the inputs to unset it.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save your changes">
    Click the "Save changes" button to apply the new throttle settings.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Opting guides out of throttle limit

In some cases, you may want to always render certain guides immediately regardless of any throttle limit that is being applied. For example, a guide component that is rendered inline therefore can always render.

You can opt out one or more guides from getting subject to the throttle limit, by moving them all the way up above the throttle settings bar while in Edit order mode.

Any guides you move into this section will bypass any throttle imit being applied. They will also be returned ahead of other throttled guides.
