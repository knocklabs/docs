Knock provides a complete set of APIs to power your in-app notifications when creating notifications for the Knock-powered in-app channel. These APIs cover:

- Fetching a reverse chronological list of in-app feed messages for a user.
- Retrieving badge count information on the number of seen and unread messages a user has. 
- Handling message engagement to mark messages as seen, read, and archived.
- Real-time delivery of in-app messages from Knock to your user.

Our client-side SDKs wrap these APIs and provide a convienient way to interact with the Knock APIs.

## Security model

Knock's in-app APIs are accessible via our client SDKs, which use your public API key to authenticate. In addition, we support an enhanced security mode that signs a request against the current user and provides an additional authorization mechanism. You can read more in [our security documentation](/in-app-ui/security-and-authentication).

## Real-time delivery

Knock provides a real-time, web socket connection for your users to subscribe to new messages being produced on an in-app channel. The events we currently send over the websocket are:

| Event                              | Description                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `new-message`                         | Emitted when a new message is produced over an in-app channel. Will not contain the full message contents, but will include metadata about the updated badge counts. Might be throttled.         |

## Message contents (`FeedItem`)

Each in-app message will contain the contents of the template
