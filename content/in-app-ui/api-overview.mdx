Knock provides a complete set of APIs to render your in-app notifications with the Knock-powered in-app channel. These APIs cover:

- Fetching a reverse chronological list of in-app feed messages for a user. ([API reference](/reference#get-feed)).
- Retrieving badge count information on the number of seen and unread messages a user has.
- Handling message engagement statuses to mark messages as seen, read, and archived.
- Real-time delivery of in-app messages from Knock to your user.

Our client-side SDKs wrap these APIs and provide a convenient way to interact with the Knock APIs.

## Security model

Knock's in-app APIs are accessible via our client SDKs, which use your public API key to authenticate. In addition, we support an enhanced security mode that signs a request against the current user and provides an additional authorization mechanism. You can read more in [our security documentation](/in-app-ui/security-and-authentication).

## Real-time delivery

Knock provides a real-time web socket connection for your users to subscribe to new messages being produced on an in-app channel. The events we currently send over the web socket are:

| Event         | Description                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `new-message` | Emitted when a new message is produced over an in-app channel. Will not contain the full message contents, but will include metadata about the updated badge counts. Might be throttled. |

## Filtering in-app notifications

It's possible to pass filters to the in-app messages endpoint. This allows you to:

- Only return in-app messages for a particular tenant
- Only return archived or unarchived messages
- Filter messages by the `data` payload used to trigger the notification

You can see the full set of available filters in the [endpoint documentation](/reference#get-feed).

<Callout
  emoji="ðŸ’¡"
  text={
    <>
      <strong>Note:</strong> by default all <code>archived</code> messages are
      excluded from the feed.
    </>
  }
/>

Please note, by default all `archived` messages are not displayed.

### Message content blocks (`ContentBlock`)

Each in-app message will contain the contents of the message template that was used to generate the message, which you can use to display your in-app notifications. You'll find this content under the `blocks` attribute on each `FeedItem` returned. Each block includes:

Each `ContentBlock` is one of: `MarkdownContentBlock`, `TextContentBlock`, `ButtonSetContentBlock` defined by the `type` attribute.

#### `MarkdownContentBlock`

Represents a markdown content block that will have rendered HTML content.

<Attributes>
  <Attribute
    name="key"
    type="string"
    description="A unique key for the block."
  />
  <Attribute
    name="rendered"
    type="string"
    description="The rendered liquid content as HTML."
  />
  <Attribute
    name="content"
    type="string"
    description="The markdown liquid template string."
  />
  <Attribute name="type" type="markdown" description="The type of block." />
</Attributes>

#### `TextContentBlock`

Represents a plaintext content block.

<Attributes>
  <Attribute
    name="key"
    type="string"
    description="A unique key for the block."
  />
  <Attribute
    name="rendered"
    type="string"
    description="The rendered liquid content as plaintext."
  />
  <Attribute
    name="content"
    type="string"
    description="The plaintext liquid template string."
  />
  <Attribute name="type" type="text" description="The type of block." />
</Attributes>

#### `ButtonSetContentBlock`

Represents a set of one or more buttons that can be rendered in the in-app message.

<Attributes>
  <Attribute
    name="key"
    type="string"
    description="A unique key for the block."
  />
  <Attribute
    name="buttons"
    type="ActionButton[]"
    description="A list of buttons to render in the block."
  />
  <Attribute name="type" type="button_set" description="The type of block." />
</Attributes>

Each button set block will contain an array of `ActionButton` objects. Each button includes:

<Attributes>
  <Attribute
    name="name"
    type="string"
    description="One of primary or secondary."
  />
  <Attribute
    name="label"
    type="string"
    description="The label to show on the button."
  />
  <Attribute
    name="action"
    type="string"
    description="The URI for this action."
  />
</Attributes>

### Passing through data

When triggering a workflow that generates an in-app message, all of the `data` in the workflow run scope will be included in the generated in-app message payload. This makes it possible to pass through identifiers from your system to your in-app notifications that you can then use to render custom UI elements.

Here's an example: if you trigger a workflow with `{ "project_id": "proj_123" }` which generates an in-app message, you can expect the `data` in the `FeedItem` to include this `project_id`.

### Customizing in-app API responses

It's also possible to override the response of the in-app API to hide sensitive data using an allow/deny list. You can [read more on doing so here](/integrations/in-app/knock#customizing-api-response-content).

## Message statuses

All messages returned from the in-app channel adhere to our message status and engagement APIs. That means it's possible to programmatically mark the messages as seen, read, interacted with, or archived. You can read more in our [message status documentation](/send-notifications/message-statuses), or read more on how we use these message statuses [on the in-app channel](/integrations/in-app/knock#how-the-knock-in-app-feed-uses-status).

## Working with actionable notifications

In-app notification messages (`FeedItem`) are "actionable" and can be one of three types:

- **Standard**: indicates that the entire cell is potentially actionable (e.g., clicking anywhere on the cell will trigger an action).
- **Single-action**: indicates that the notification cell has a single action button that can be clicked.
- **Multi-action**: indicates that the notification cell has both a primary and secondary set of actions that can be clicked.

Working with actionable notifications is straightforward. If you're using out-of-the-box Knock UI components, we'll handle the rendering of actionable notifications for you. 

If you're building a custom feed implementation, you can check the `blocks` attribute for the presence of a `ButtonSetContentBlock` and render the `buttons` contained within the block accordingly.
