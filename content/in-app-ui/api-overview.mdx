Knock provides a complete set of APIs to render your in-app notifications with the Knock-powered in-app channel. These APIs cover:

- Fetching a reverse chronological list of in-app feed messages for a user. ([API reference](/reference#get-feed)).
- Retrieving badge count information on the number of seen and unread messages a user has.
- Handling message engagement statuses to mark messages as seen, read, and archived.
- Real-time delivery of in-app messages from Knock to your user.

Our client-side SDKs wrap these APIs and provide a convenient way to interact with the Knock APIs.

## Security model

Knock's in-app APIs are accessible via our client SDKs, which use your public API key to authenticate. In addition, we support an enhanced security mode that signs a request against the current user and provides an additional authorization mechanism. You can read more in [our security documentation](/in-app-ui/security-and-authentication).

## Real-time delivery

Knock provides a real-time web socket connection for your users to subscribe to new messages being produced on an in-app channel. The events we currently send over the web socket are:

| Event         | Description                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `new-message` | Emitted when a new message is produced over an in-app channel. Will not contain the full message contents, but will include metadata about the updated badge counts. Might be throttled. |

## Filtering in-app notifications

It's possible to pass filters to the in-app messages endpoint. This allows you to:

- Only return in-app messages for a particular tenant
- Only return archived or unarchived messages
- Filter messages by the `data` payload used to trigger the notification

You can see the full set of available filters in the [endpoint documentation](/reference#get-feed). Please note, by default all `archived` messages are not displayed.

## In-app API response

### `FeedMetadata`

<Attributes>
  <Attribute
    name="total_count"
    type="number"
    description="The total number of messages the user has for this in-app channel."
  />
  <Attribute
    name="unread_count"
    type="number"
    description="The total number of unread items the user has on the in-app channel."
  />
  <Attribute
    name="unseen_count"
    type="number"
    description="The total number of unseen items the user has on the in-app channel."
  />
</Attributes>

### `FeedItem`

Requests to the feed endpoint will return a `FeedItem`. Each feed item includes:

<Attributes>
  <Attribute
    name="id"
    type="string"
    description="A unique identifier for the item."
  />
  <Attribute
    name="actors"
    type="Recipient[]"
    description="One or more actors that were attributed to the workflow run."
  />
  <Attribute
    name="total_actors"
    type="number"
    description="The total count of unique actors includes across all workflow runs that generated this message."
  />
  <Attribute
    name="activities"
    type="Activity[]"
    description="One or more activities associated with this in-app message. Will only include multiple activities when the message was generated from a batch."
  />
  <Attribute
    name="total_activities"
    type="number"
    description="The total count of workflow runs that generated this message. Will only be > 1 when used with a batch."
  />
  <Attribute
    name="activities"
    type="Activity[]"
    description="One or more activities associated with this in-app message. Will only include multiple activities when the message was generated from a batch."
  />
  <Attribute
    name="data"
    type="Record<string, any>"
    description="The combined workflow run data associated with this message. See below for more information."
  />
  <Attribute
    name="blocks"
    type="ContentBlock[]"
    description="The rendered contents of each feed item. See below for more information."
  />
  <Attribute
    name="source"
    type="WorkflowSource"
    description="The key, version_id, and categories of the workflow that generated this in-app message."
  />
  <Attribute
    name="tenant"
    type="string"
    description="An optional tenant identifier that was set in the workflow run scope."
  />
  <Attribute
    name="archived_at"
    type="utc_datetime"
    description="An optional tenant identifier that was set in the workflow run scope."
  />
  <Attribute
    name="read_at"
    type="utc_datetime"
    description="When set, indicates the last time the message was marked as read."
  />
  <Attribute
    name="seen_at"
    type="utc_datetime"
    description="When set, indicates the last time the message was marked as seen."
  />
  <Attribute
    name="link_clicked_at"
    type="utc_datetime"
    description="When set, indicates the last time the message was clicked."
  />
  <Attribute
    name="inserted_at"
    type="utc_datetime"
    description="The time the message was generated."
  />
  <Attribute
    name="updated_at"
    type="utc_datetime"
    description="The time the message was last updated."
  />
</Attributes>

### Message content blocks (`ContentBlock`)

Each in-app message will contain the contents of the message template that was used to generate the message, which you can use to display your in-app notifications. You'll find this content under the `blocks` attribute on each `FeedItem` returned. Each block includes:

<Attributes>
  <Attribute
    name="key"
    type="string"
    description="A unique key for the block."
  />
  <Attribute
    name="type"
    type="markdown | string"
    description="The type of block."
  />
  <Attribute
    name="rendered"
    type="string"
    description="The complete rendered content for the block."
  />
  <Attribute
    name="content"
    type="string"
    description="The liquid template associated with the block."
  />
</Attributes>

**Note**: when the block type is `markdown`, the `rendered` content will always be HTML that should be rendered for the in-app message.

### Passing through data

When triggering a workflow that generates an in-app message, by default all of the `data` in the workflow run scope will be embedded into the generated in-app message. That makes it possible to pass through identifiers from your system to your in-app notifications that you can use. Here's an example: if I triggered a workflow with `{ "project_id": "proj_123" }` which generated an in-app message, then I can expect the `data` in the `FeedItem` to include this project_id.

### Customizing in-app API responses

It's also possible to override the response of the in-app API to hide sensitive data using an allow/deny list. You can [read more on doing so here](/integrations/in-app/knock#customizing-api-response-content).

## Message statuses

All messages returned from the in-app channel adhere to our message status and engagement APIs. That means it's possible to programmatically mark the messages as seen, read, interacted with, or archived. You can read more in our [message status documentation](/send-notifications/message-statuses), or read more on how we use these message statuses [on the in-app channel](/integrations/in-app/knock#how-the-knock-in-app-feed-uses-status).
