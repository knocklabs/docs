In this guide, you'll find common recipes to help you build in-app feed experiences within your React Native applications. The SDK handles all aspects of managing the data surrounding notifications on your behalf, including managing unread badge counts.

      in the current version of the React Native SDK there are no pre-built UI
      components. That means you must bring your own notification components to
      render an in-app feed.
    </>
  }

**Quick links**:

- [`@knocklabs/react-native` library reference](/in-app-ui/react-native/sdk/reference)
- [`@knocklabs/client` library reference](/in-app-ui/javascript/sdk/reference)

## Getting started

To use this example, you'll need [an account on Knock](https://dashboard.knock.app), as well as an in-app feed channel with a workflow that produces in-app feed messages. You'll also need:

- A public API key for the Knock environment (set as `KNOCK_PUBLIC_API_KEY`)
- The channel ID for the in-app feed (set as `KNOCK_FEED_CHANNEL_ID`)

## Installing dependencies

```bash title="Installing dependencies"
npm install @knocklabs/react-native
```

## Rendering a notification feed

      By default, Knock feeds are accessible to anyone who has the feed ID. This makes it
      easy to get started in development. To secure your feed for production,
      enable enhanced security mode in your Knock dashboard and pass a signed
      {" "}<code>userToken</code> as a prop to the <code>KnockFeedProvider</code> component.

      for client-side applications.

```jsx
import {
  KnockFeedProvider,
  KnockProvider,
  NotificationIconButton,
  NotificationFeed,
  FilterStatus,
} from "@knocklabs/react-native";
import React, { useCallback, useState } from "react";
import { StyleSheet, View, StatusBar } from "react-native";

const App: React.FC = () => {
  const [isNotificationFeedOpen, setIsNotificationFeedOpen] = useState(false);
  const onTopActionButtonTap = useCallback(() => {
    setIsNotificationFeedOpen(!isNotificationFeedOpen);
  }, [isNotificationFeedOpen]);

  return (
    <KnockProvider
      apiKey={process.env.KNOCK_PUBLIC_API_KEY}
      host={process.env.KNOCK_HOST}
      userId={process.env.KNOCK_USER_ID}
      logLevel="debug"
    >
      <KnockFeedProvider feedId={process.env.KNOCK_FEED_CHANNEL_ID}>
        <View style={styles.container}>
          <StatusBar />
          {!isNotificationFeedOpen && (
            <NotificationIconButton
              onClick={onTopActionButtonTap}
              badgeCountType={"unread"}
            />
          )}
          {isNotificationFeedOpen && (
            <NotificationFeed
              initialFilterStatus={FilterStatus.Unread}
              onCellActionButtonTap={({ button, item }) => {
                console.log("Action button tapped", button, item);
              }}
              onRowTap={(item) => {
                console.log("Row tapped", item);
              }}
            />
          )}
        </View>
      </KnockFeedProvider>
    </KnockProvider>
  );
};

export default App;
```

## Common feed recipes

### Filtering/scoping a feed

A feed can be scoped by any of the parameters that are accepted on the [feed endpoint](/api-reference/users/feeds/list_items) via the `FeedClientOptions` set in the `defaultFeedOptions` for the `KnockFeedProvider` component, or via the `useNotifications` hook.

You can read more in this [guide on feed filtering](/in-app-ui/react/filtering-in-app-feeds).
