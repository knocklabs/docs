The Knock React Native SDK provides pre-built UI components that you can use to easily get up and running with a fully functional notification feed experience in your product. You can also use a set of React hooks and API bindings for you to build custom UI on top of to power in-app notification experiences in your React Native applications.

## Features

- API methods for interacting with the [Knock in-app API](/in-app-ui/api-overview).
- Managed websocket connections to the Knock real-time service.
- State management for powering in-app feeds, with optimistic client-side updates.

## Getting started

Please reference our [React Native SDK documentation](/sdks/react-native/quick-start) to set up the library.

```bash
npm install @knocklabs/react-native
```

When using React Native with Expo, install [our Expo SDK](/sdks/expo/overview) instead:

```bash
npm install @knocklabs/expo
```

### In-app notifications

- `NotificationFeed`: A full-page list of notifications.
- `NotificationIconButton`: A button with a badge count for notifications, often used to open the `NotificationFeed`.
