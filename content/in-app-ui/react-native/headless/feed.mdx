Using our `@knocklabs/react-native` and `@knocklabs/client` libraries, you can create fully custom notification UIs that are backed by the Knock Feed API and real-time service.

In this guide, we'll take a look at creating a completely custom notifications UI in our application in a headless way using Knock's hooks.

## Getting started

To use this example, you'll need [an account on Knock](https://dashboard.knock.app), as well as an in-app feed channel with a workflow that produces in-app feed messages. You'll also need:

- A public API key for the Knock environment (set as `KNOCK_PUBLIC_API_KEY`)
- The channel ID for the in-app feed (set as `KNOCK_FEED_CHANNEL_ID`)

<Callout

      To find the channel ID for your in-app channel(s), navigate to{" "}
      <span className="font-bold">Channels and sources</span> under the account
      settings section of your Knock dashboard, click on your in-app feed
      channel, and copy the channel ID.
    </>
  }
/>

## Installing dependencies

```bash title="Installing dependencies"
npm install @knocklabs/react-native
```

## Implement `KnockProvider`

First, we'll need to implement the `KnockProvider` component somewhere in your component tree and authenticate against the Knock API using a user id and API key.

```jsx title="Implement KnockProvider in your app"
import { KnockProvider } from "@knocklabs/react-native";

const App = ({ user }) => (
  <KnockProvider
    apiKey={process.env.KNOCK_PUBLIC_API_KEY}
    user={{ id: user.id }}
  >
    <NotificationFeed />
  </KnockProvider>
);
```

## Setup the Knock client

Next, we'll need to access the instance of the Knock client created by the `KnockProvider` using the `useKnockClient` hook.

```jsx title="Access the configured knockClient using useKnockClient"
import { useKnockClient } from "@knocklabs/react-native";

const NotificationFeed = ({ user }) => {
  const knockClient = useKnockClient();

  return null;
};
```

## Setup the Knock feed instance

Next, we'll want to set up an instance of a Knock Feed, which will handle the state management and provide a way for us to interact with the messages on the feed.

```jsx title="Create a feed store with Zustand"
import {
  useKnockClient,
  useNotifications,
  useNotificationStore,
} from "@knocklabs/react-native";
import { useEffect } from "react";

const NotificationFeed = ({ user }) => {
  const knockClient = useKnockClient();
  const feedClient = useNotifications(
    knockClient,
    process.env.KNOCK_FEED_CHANNEL_ID,
  );

  const { items, metadata } = useNotificationStore(feedClient);

  useEffect(() => {
    feedClient.fetch();
  }, [feedClient]);

  return null;
};
```

## Creating a custom notifications UI

The last step is to render our notifications UI using the data that's exposed via the state store (`items` and `metadata`).

```jsx title="Render items and metadata in the feed"
import {
  useKnockClient,
  useNotifications,
  useNotificationStore,
} from "@knocklabs/react-native";
import { useEffect } from "react";

const NotificationFeed = ({ user }) => {
  const knockClient = useKnockClient();
  const feedClient = useNotifications(
    knockClient,
    process.env.KNOCK_FEED_CHANNEL_ID,
  );

  const { items, metadata } = useNotificationStore(feedClient);

  useEffect(() => {
    feedClient.fetch();
  }, [feedClient]);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Total unread: {metadata.unread_count}</Text>
      {items.map(item => (
        <View key={item.id}>
          {/* Notification cell goes here */}
        </View>
      )}
    </View>
  );
};
```

## Common feed recipes

### Filtering/scoping a feed

A feed can be scoped by any of the parameters that are accepted on the [feed endpoint](/api-reference/users/feeds/list_items) via the `FeedClientOptions` set in the `defaultFeedOptions` for the `KnockFeedProvider` component, or via the `useNotifications` hook.

You can read more in this [guide on feed filtering](/in-app-ui/react/filtering-in-app-feeds).
