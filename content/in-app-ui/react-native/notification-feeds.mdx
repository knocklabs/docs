In this guide, you'll find common recipes to help you build in-app feed experiences within your React Native applications. The SDK handles all aspects of managing the data surrounding notifications on your behalf, including managing unread badge counts.

<Callout

    <>
      <span className="font-bold">Note</span> in the current version of the
      React Native SDK there are no pre-built UI components. That means you must
      bring your own notification components to render an in-app feed.
    </>
  }

**Quick links**:

- [`@knocklabs/react-native` library reference](/in-app-ui/react-native/reference)
- [`@knocklabs/client` library reference](/in-app-ui/javascript/reference)

## Getting started

To use this example, you'll need [an account on Knock](https://dashboard.knock.app), as well as an in-app feed channel with a workflow that produces in-app feed messages. You'll also need:

- A public API key for the Knock environment (set as `KNOCK_PUBLIC_API_KEY`)
- The channel ID for the in-app feed (set as `KNOCK_FEED_CHANNEL_ID`)

## Installing dependencies

```bash Installing dependencies
npm install @knocklabs/react-native
```

## Rendering a notification feed

<Callout emoji="🔐"
  text={
    <>
      <span className="font-bold">Secure your feed: </span> By default, Knock
      feeds are accessible to anyone who has the feed ID. This makes it
      easy to get started in development. To secure your feed for production,
      enable enhanced security mode in your Knock dashboard and pass a signed
      {" "}<code>userToken</code> as a prop to the <code>KnockFeedProvider</code> component.

      for client-side applications.
    </>

### Using the `KnockFeedProvider`

```jsx
import { useEffect } from "react";
import { KnockFeedProvider, useKnockFeed } from "@knocklabs/react-native";

const YourApp = () => {
  const currentUser = useCurrentUser();

  return (
    <KnockFeedProvider
      apiKey={process.env.KNOCK_PUBLIC_API_KEY}
      feedId={process.env.KNOCK_FEED_CHANNEL_ID}
      userId={currentUser.id}
      // In production, you must pass a signed userToken
      // and enable enhanced security mode in your Knock dashboard
      // userToken={currentUser.knockUserToken}
    >
      <NotificationFeed />
    </KnockFeedProvider>
  );
};

const NotificationFeed = () => {
  const { useFeedStore, feedClient } = useKnockFeed();
  const { items, metadata } = useFeedStore();

  // Fetch the feed
  useEffect(() => feedClient.fetch(), [feedClient]);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Total unread: {metadata.unread_count}</Text>
      {items.map(item => (
        <View key={item.id}>
          {/* Notification cell goes here */}
        </View>
      )}
    </View>
  )
};
```

### Using the `useNotifications` hook

```jsx
import {
  useAuthenticatedKnockClient,
  useNotifications,
} from "@knocklabs/react-native";
import create from "zustand";

const MyNotificationsFeed = () => {
  const knock = useAuthenticatedKnockClient(
    process.env.KNOCK_PUBLIC_API_KEY,
    user.id,
    user.knockToken,
  );

  const notificationFeed = useNotifications(
    knock,
    process.env.KNOCK_FEED_CHANNEL_ID,
  );

  const useNotificationStore = create(notificationFeed.store);
  const { metadata, items } = useNotificationStore();

  // Fetch the feed contents
  useEffect(() => {
    notificationFeed.fetch();
  }, [notificationFeed]);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Total unread: {metadata.unread_count}</Text>
      {items.map(item => (
        <View key={item.id}>
          {/* Notification cell goes here */}
        </View>
      )}
    </View>
  );
};
```

## Common feed recipes

### Filtering/scoping a feed

A feed can be scoped by any of the parameters that are accepted on the [feed endpoint](/reference#get-feed) via the `FeedClientOptions` set in the `defaultFeedOptions` for the `KnockFeedProvider` component, or via the `useNotifications` hook.

You can read more in this [guide on feed filtering](/guides/filtering-in-app-feeds).
