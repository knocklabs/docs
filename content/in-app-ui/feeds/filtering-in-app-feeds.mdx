When building an in-app notifications UI, you can filter notifications to increase their relevancy for your users. This is particularly useful for:

- A multi-tenant SaaS application where users need to see tenant-specific notifications
- Applications that need to show contextual notifications for specific resources
- Separating notifications by engagement status (unread, read, seen, archived)
- Separating notifications by a custom property (e.g. `priority: "high"`, `status: "incomplete"`)

In this guide, we'll explore how to filter the feed API using `defaultFeedOptions`. These filters apply to all feed results, including real-time updates and badge counts for unseen or unread notifications.

      The feed client accepts default options that apply to both the initial
      feed fetch and real-time updates. This guide demonstrates how to set these
      defaults. You can also override these values when calling the{" "}
      <code>fetch</code> function.

## Filtering by tenant

In a multi-tenant SaaS application, users often belong to one or more tenants, and their notifications should be scoped to the tenant they're currently viewing.

For example, consider a user named `jane` in a document editing app. Jane's profile is connected to two workspaces: `acme-inc` and `superior-products`. When Jane is active in the `acme-inc` workspace, she should only see notifications relevant to that workspace.

Knock implements this concept through [Tenancy](/concepts/tenants), where workflow triggers can be "tagged" with a tenant identifier. This identifier can be used to apply tenant overrides and scope in-app notifications. Here's how it works:

```js title="Triggering our workflow with a tenant"
await knock.workflows.trigger("new-comment", {
  recipients: ["jane"],
  data: {
    pageId: page.id,
    commentId: comment.id,
  },
  tenant: workspace.id,
});
```

To scope the in-app feed by the user's current tenant:

```javascript title="Rendering our feed with the tenant filter"
// Passed to our component
<KnockFeedProvider
  feedId={process.env.KNOCK_FEED_CHANNEL_ID}
  defaultFeedOptions={{ tenant: "acme-inc" }}
/>;

// Passed to the `useNotifications` hook as `FeedClientOptions`
useNotifications(knockClient, process.env.KNOCK_FEED_CHANNEL_ID, {
  tenant: "acme-inc",
});
```

By default, filtering by tenant includes all notifications that either:

- Include the specified tenant
- Were sent without a tenant identifier

If you need to show only notifications for a specific tenant, you can add `has_tenant: true` to your filter:

```javascript
defaultFeedOptions={{ tenant: "acme-inc", has_tenant: true }}
```

## Filtering by workflow

To show notifications from a specific workflow in your in-app feed, use the `source` filter. For example, in a document collaboration application, you might want to show only notifications from the `new-comment` workflow:

```js title="Filtering our in-app feed by source"
// Passed to our component
<KnockFeedProvider
  feedId={process.env.KNOCK_FEED_CHANNEL_ID}
  defaultFeedOptions={{ source: "new-comment" }}
/>;

// Passed to the `useNotifications` hook as `FeedClientOptions`
useNotifications(knockClient, process.env.KNOCK_FEED_CHANNEL_ID, {
  source: "new-comment",
});
```

Note: Currently, filtering by multiple sources is not supported.

## Filtering by `data`

You can filter the feed using properties from the `data` payload in your trigger step. This provides a flexible way to query feed data based on your system's entities. For example, to show comment notifications for a specific page in your document editing app:

```js title="Triggering a workflow with data"
await knock.workflows.trigger("new-comment", {
  recipients: recipientIds,
  data: {
    pageId: page.id,
    commentId: comment.id,
  },
});
```

To filter the feed by this data:

```js title="Filtering our in-app feed by trigger data"
// Passed to our component
<KnockFeedProvider
  feedId={process.env.KNOCK_FEED_CHANNEL_ID}
  defaultFeedOptions={{ trigger_data: { pageId } }}
/>;

// Passed to the `useNotifications` hook as `FeedClientOptions`
useNotifications(knockClient, process.env.KNOCK_FEED_CHANNEL_ID, {
  trigger_data: { pageId },
});
```

Important limitations to be aware of when filtering by data:

1. You can only filter by top-level keys in your data payload (e.g., `data.foo` is supported, but `data.foo.bar` is not)
2. Only exact value matching is supported (partial matches and comparison operators are not available)

## Learn more about feed filtering

For a complete list of filtering options, refer to the [API reference](/api-reference/users/feeds/list_items). These options are available through the `FeedClientOptions` type, which you can use to:

- Set default filters in the feed constructor
- Override defaults for individual fetch operations
