Knock enables you to build engaging in-app feed experiences with a rich set of interactivity features across all supported platforms (Web, iOS, Android, and React Native). This documentation covers the various ways you can handle user interactions with your feed components.

## Common interaction patterns

### Clicking and tapping

All Knock feed components support handling user interactions through click/tap events:

#### Web (React)

```jsx title="Handling notification interactions in React"
<NotificationFeed
  onNotificationClick={(item) => {
    // Handle notification cell click
  }}
  onNotificationButtonClick={(item, button) => {
    // Handle button click within notification
  }}
/>
```

#### iOS

```swift title="Handling notification interactions in iOS"
KnockInAppFeedView()
    .onReceive(viewModel.didTapFeedItemButtonPublisher) { actionString in
        // Handle button tap
    }
    .onReceive(viewModel.didTapFeedItemRowPublisher) { item in
        // Handle row tap
    }
```

#### Android

```kotlin title="Handling notification interactions in Android"
feedViewModel.didTapFeedItemRowPublisher
    .onEach { feedItem ->
        // Handle feed item row tap
    }
    .launchIn(this)

feedViewModel.didTapFeedItemButtonPublisher
    .onEach { feedItemButtonEvent ->
        // Handle button tap
    }
    .launchIn(this)
```

#### React Native

```jsx title="Handling notification interactions in React Native"
<NotificationFeed
  onRowTap={(item) => {
    // Handle row tap
  }}
  onCellActionButtonTap={({ button, item }) => {
    // Handle button tap
  }}
/>
```

### URL handling

Knock supports automatic URL handling for notifications:

1. **Action URLs.** You can specify an `action_url` in your notification template, and Knock will automatically handle redirects when users interact with the notification.

2. **Custom URL handling.** You can implement custom URL handling logic in your click handlers to control navigation behavior.

### State management

Knock provides built-in state management for notification interactions:

1. **Mark as read.** Notifications can be automatically marked as read when:

   - The feed is opened
   - A notification is clicked
   - A button within a notification is clicked

2. **Mark as seen.** Notifications are automatically marked as seen when they appear in the feed viewport.

3. **Archiving.** Users can archive notifications through swipe actions or dedicated buttons.
