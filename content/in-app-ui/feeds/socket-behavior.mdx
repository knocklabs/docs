The Knock in-app real-time service is a managed service that provides a websocket connection to your application. This websocket connection is used to receive notifications from Knock when new messages are sent to an in-app feed channel.

Our socket infrastructure is designed to be reliable and scalable, handling real-time updates for your in-app feeds. When new messages arrive in a feed channel, Knock automatically pushes these updates to your application through the websocket connection, ensuring your users receive notifications in real-time.

The socket connection is automatically managed by our SDKs, handling connection lifecycle, reconnection logic, and message delivery. This allows you to focus on building your application without worrying about the complexities of real-time infrastructure.

## Customizing socket behavior

You can customize the socket behavior of your in-app feeds by passing options to the feed component. These options allow you to control various aspects of the socket connection, including:

- Auto-disconnect management for inactive tabs
- Cross-browser feed synchronization

You can learn more about customizing the socket behavior in our feed [socket behavior options](/in-app-ui/react/feed#socket-behavior-options).
