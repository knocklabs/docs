While you can use our pre-built UI components to integrate an in-app notification feed into your application, you can also create your own feed UI by using Knock's SDKs and by bringing your own UI components.

Knock's client SDKs for Javascript, React, React Native, Flutter, iOS, and Android ship with access to the underlying data stores and APIs to power your own feed UI. Using these primitives, it's possible to build a completely custom feed experience that leverages your design system and brand, without needing to build any of the backend infrastructure.

## Javascript

You can use the `@knocklabs/client` package to build your own feed UI, where you'll have access to the underlying `FeedClient` instance and state store. For more information, see the [Javascript SDK documentation](/in-app-ui/javascript/sdk/reference).

## React

If you're using the React SDK, you can use our hooks to build your own feed UI. You'll find more in the [React SDK documentation](/in-app-ui/react/headless/feed).

## React Native

If you're using the React Native SDK, you can use our hooks to build your own feed UI. You'll find more in the [React Native SDK documentation](/in-app-ui/react-native/headless/feed).

## Flutter

If you're using the Flutter SDK, you can use the FeedClient instance to build your own feed UI on top of. You'll find more in the [Flutter SDK documentation](/in-app-ui/flutter/sdk/reference).

## iOS (Swift)

If you're using the iOS SDK, you can use the FeedManager instance to build your own feed UI on top of. You'll find more in the [iOS SDK documentation](/in-app-ui/ios/sdk/reference).

## Android (Kotlin)

If you're using the Android SDK, you can use the FeedManager instance to build your own feed UI on top of. You'll find more in the [Android SDK documentation](/in-app-ui/android/sdk/reference).
