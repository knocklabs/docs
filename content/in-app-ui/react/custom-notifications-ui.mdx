description: How to build custom notifications UI powered by Knock and React.
section: Building in-app UI
---

Using our `@knocklabs/react` and `@knocklabs/client` libraries, you can create fully custom notification UIs that are backed by the Knock Feed API and Websockets to receive and process real-time notifications in your web application.

In this guide, we'll take a look at creating a completely custom notifications page in our application.

## Getting started

To use this example, you'll need [an account on Knock](https://dashboard.knock.app), as well as an in-app feed channel with a workflow that produces in-app feed messages. You'll also need:

- A public API key for the Knock environment (set as `KNOCK_PUBLIC_API_KEY`)
- The channel ID for the in-app feed (set as `KNOCK_FEED_CHANNEL_ID`)

<Callout

    <>
      <span className="font-bold">Find your channel ID.</span> To find the
      channel ID for your in-app channel(s), go to {"Integrations > Channels"}{" "}
      in the Knock dashboard, navigate to the channel page of your in-app
      channel, and copy the channel ID.
    </>
  }
/>

## Installing dependencies

```bash Installing dependencies
npm install @knocklabs/react
```

## Adding the Knock providers

We'll need to wrap our notifications page in a `KnockProvider` and `KnockFeedProvider` to setup a connection to Knock and connect to the authenticated user's feed. You can read more about the available props for the feed provider in [the reference](/in-app-ui/react/reference#knockprovider).

```jsx
import { KnockProvider, KnockFeedProvider } from "@knocklabs/react";

const NotificationsPage = () => {
  const { user } = useCurrentUser();

  return (
    <KnockProvider apiKey={process.env.KNOCK_PUBLIC_API_KEY} userId={user.id}>
      <KnockFeedProvider feedId={process.env.KNOCK_FEED_CHANNEL_ID}>
        <NotificationsList />
      </KnockFeedProvider>
    </KnockProvider>
  );
};
```

## Creating a custom notifications page

In our notifications page, we'll use the store exposed by the `KnockFeedProvider` in order to render the list of notifications that we have available.

```jsx
const NotificationsList = () => {
  const { feedClient, useFeedStore } = useKnockFeed();
  const items = useFeedStore((state) => state.items);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Once the feedClient is available, calling .fetch() will
    // populate the feed. In the background, a websocket is
    // opened that will receive new messages in real time.
    feedClient.fetch();
  }, [feedClient]);

  return (
    <div className="notifications">
      {items.map((item) => (
        <NotificationCell key={item.id} item={item} />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
};
```

## Creating a notification cell

We'll want to render a notification cell for every notification in our feed. Lets wrap that behavior up in a component for easy reuse:

```jsx
type Props = {
  item: FeedItem,
};

const NotificationCell: React.FC<Props> = ({ item }) => {
  // Group the content blocks by the name for easy lookup
  const blocksByName = useMemo(() => {
    return item.blocks.reduce((acc, block) => {
      return { ...acc, [block.name]: block };
    }, {});
  }, [item]);

  const maybeActor = item.actors[0];

  return (
    <div className="notification-cell">
      {maybeActor && (
        <span class="notification-cell__actor">{maybeActor.name}</span>
      )}

      {blocksByName.body && (
        <div
          className="notification-cell__content"
          dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: blocksByName.body.rendered }}
        />
      )}
    </div>
  );
};
```

## Wrapping up

There's a lot more we can do with our notifications page, but we'll leave that as an exercise to the reader. Here are some examples:

- Adding mark as read, and archiving behavior to the notification cell
- Displaying a count of the total number of notifications

Check out the feed guide in the `@knocklabs/client` reference to learn about the available methods.
