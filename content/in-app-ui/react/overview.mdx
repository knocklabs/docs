Our [`@knocklabs/react`](https://github.com/knocklabs/javascript/tree/main/packages/react) library lets you create notification experiences using Knock's APIs. It comes with pre-built UI components that you can use to easily get up and running with a fully functional notification feed experience in your product.

## Pre-built components

The Knock React SDK ships the following pre-built UI elements:

### In-app notifications

- `NotificationFeedPopover`: a managed popover for displaying a list of notifications.
- `NotificationFeed`: a full-page list of notifications.
- `NotificationIconButton`: for adding a bell icon to your application that shows the current count of unread or unseen notifications.

### SlackKit

- `SlackChannelCombobox`: for picking one or more Slack channels to route notifications to.
- `SlackAuthButton`: for managing the OAuth process between your Slack application and your customer's Slack workspace.

## Hooks for headless UI

If you don't want to use the pre-built UI components, you can also use this library in a headless way and bring your own UI. The Knock React SDK includes a complete set of React hooks that you can use to build your own UI on top of.
