Our `@knocklabs/react` library comes pre-built with a real-time feed component that you can drop into your application. In this guide, you'll find common recipes to help you work with the pre-built Knock feed UI element.

[See a live demo of our pre-built in-app feed UI element ->](https://in-app-demo.knock.app/)

## Getting started

To use this example, you'll need [an account on Knock](https://dashboard.knock.app), as well as an in-app feed channel with a workflow that produces in-app feed messages. You'll also need:

- A public API key for the Knock environment (set as `KNOCK_PUBLIC_API_KEY`)
- The channel ID for the in-app feed (set as `KNOCK_FEED_CHANNEL_ID`)

      To find the channel ID for your in-app channel(s), go to{" "}
      <span className="font-bold">Integrations</span> {">"}{" "}
      <span className="font-bold">Channels</span> in the Knock dashboard,
      navigate to the channel page of your in-app channel, and copy the channel
      ID.

## Rendering a notification feed (prebuilt UI element)

To add a real-time notifications feed to your product, you can use the out-of-the-box components that the `@knocklabs/react` library offers.

      easy to get started in development. To secure your feed for production,
      enable enhanced security mode in your Knock dashboard and pass a signed

```jsx
import { useState, useRef } from "react";
import {
  KnockProvider,
  KnockFeedProvider,
  NotificationIconButton,
  NotificationFeedPopover,
} from "@knocklabs/react";

// Required CSS import, unless you're overriding the styling
import "@knocklabs/react/dist/index.css";

const YourAppLayout = () => {
  const [isVisible, setIsVisible] = useState(false);
  const notifButtonRef = useRef(null);

  return (
    <KnockProvider
      apiKey={process.env.KNOCK_PUBLIC_API_KEY}
      userId={currentUser.id}
    >
      <KnockFeedProvider feedId={process.env.KNOCK_FEED_CHANNEL_ID}>
        <>
          <NotificationIconButton
            ref={notifButtonRef}
            onClick={(e) => setIsVisible(!isVisible)}
          />
          <NotificationFeedPopover
            buttonRef={notifButtonRef}
            isVisible={isVisible}
            onClose={() => setIsVisible(false)}
          />
        </>
      </KnockFeedProvider>
    </KnockProvider>
  );
};
```

## Common recipes

### Building custom UI

You can build headless notifications UI on top of our hooks. [Learn more](/in-app-ui/react/custom-notifications-ui).

### Setting an `action_url` on the notification cell

You can pass a value in the Action URL field of your notification template and the `KnockFeedProvider` will attach a redirect handler if `action_url` is not empty.

### Adding an `onClick` handler to the notification cell

You can customize the click handler for the notification cell as follows:

```jsx
import { NotificationFeed } from "@knocklabs/react";

<NotificationFeed onNotificationClick={(item) => onClose()} />;
```

Both the `NotificationFeed` and the `NotificationFeedPopover` take a `onNotificationClick` prop.

### Add an `onButtonClick` handler to the notification cell

You can add a button click handler to respond to clicks on the buttons in the notification cell. The `onNotificationButtonClick` prop is available on the `NotificationFeed` component:

```jsx
import { NotificationFeed } from "@knocklabs/react";

<NotificationFeed
  onNotificationButtonClick={(item, button) => doSomething()}
/>;
```

### Rendering a different notification cell in the feed

You can customize the rendering of a notification cell in the feed by overriding the `renderItem` prop.

```jsx
import { NotificationFeed } from "@knocklabs/react";

const MyNotificationCell = ({ item, onItemClick }) => <Outer>...</Outer>;

<NotificationFeed renderItem={(props) => <MyNotificationCell {...props} />} />;
```

### Overriding the avatar

You can customize the `Avatar` component rendered within the `NotificationCell` by passing a different `avatar` component into the `NotificationCell` in the `renderItem` function passed to the feed:

```jsx
import { NotificationFeed, NotificationCell, Avatar } from "@knocklabs/react";

<NotificationFeed
  renderItem={({ item, ...props }) => (
    <NotificationCell
      {...props}
      item={item}
      // You can use any properties available on the `actor` for the name and avatar
      avatar={<Avatar name={item.actors[0].name} src={item.actors[0].avatar} />}
    />
  )}
/>;
```

### Using `read` instead of `seen` for the badge count

```jsx
import { NotificationIconButton } from "@knocklabs/react";

<NotificationIconButton onClick={...} badgeCountType="unread" />;
```

### Marking messages as read on the popover opening

```jsx
import { NotificationFeedPopover } from "@knocklabs/react";

const onOpen = ({ store, feedClient }) => {
  const unreadItems = store.items.filter((item) => !item.read_at);

  if (unreadItems.length > 0) {
    feedClient.markAsRead(unreadItems);
  }
};

<NotificationFeedPopover
  onOpen={onOpen}
  {...}
/>;
```

### Using dark mode

The feed supports an optional `colorMode` prop, that defaults to `light` but can be set as `dark` for dark mode support.

```jsx
import { KnockFeedProvider } from "@knocklabs/react";

<KnockFeedProvider colorMode="dark" />;
```

### Rendering custom components in a notification cell

For more advanced use cases, you may need to render custom components as part of the notification cell, but don't need to override the cell entirely. For this use case, you can use the `children` prop to render custom components inside the notification cell.

```jsx
import { NotificationFeed, NotificationCell } from "@knocklabs/react";

<NotificationFeed
  renderItem={({ item, ...props }) => (
    <NotificationCell {...props} item={item}>
      <MyCustomComponent />
    </NotificationCell>
  )}
/>;
```

### Handling cross-browser feed synchronization

The `Feed` optionally supports an `__experimentalCrossBrowserUpdates` option under the `defaultFeedOptions` which will opt into using a [BroadcastChannel](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/BroadcastChannel) to keep multiple browser viewing contexts (windows, tabs) in sync for the same user feed.

You can see a demo of this behavior here:

<div style={{ position: "relative", paddingBottom: "56.25%", height: 0 }}>
  <iframe
    src="https://www.loom.com/embed/2f6bcdd4f4e14f99b92e51a404be2563"
    frameBorder="0"
    allowFullScreen
    style={{
      position: "absolute",
      top: 0,
      left: 0,
      width: "100%",
      height: "100%",
    }}
  ></iframe>
</div>

### Automatically disconnecting sockets from inactive tabs

Optionally, you can configure the `Feed` to disconnect socket connections with inactive tabs after a brief delay. If the tab becomes active again, the socket will reconnect to continue receiving real-time updates.

```jsx title="Automatically manage socket connections"
import { KnockFeedProvider } from "@knocklabs/react";

<KnockFeedProvider
  defaultFeedOptions={{
    // Turn on the automatic connection manager
    auto_manage_socket_connection: true,
    // Optionally, customize the delay amount in milliseconds. Defaults to 2000ms or 2s
    auto_manage_socket_connection_delay: 2500,
  }}
/>;
```

### Customizing the feed styling

The complete theme that controls the look and feel of the feed components can be customized for theme in a few different ways:

1. **Customizing the CSS variables**. The feed is written using CSS variables, which you can override to better match the look and feel of your product. The best way to see the possible CSS variables in use is to look at the [theme.css source code](https://github.com/knocklabs/javascript/blob/main/packages/react/src/theme.css).

2. **Bringing your own CSS**. It's possible to override the Knock CSS entirely to customize the look and feel of the feed. All of the feed classes are unique and start with `rnf-`. You can see the classes in use by looking at the [source code of the components](https://github.com/knocklabs/javascript/tree/main/packages/react/src).

### Setting custom translations

You can set custom translations for the components inside the feed by passing the `i18n` property to the `KnockProvider` component. You can provide a partial or full set of translations to be used [following the expected `I18nContent` type](/in-app-ui/react/sdk/reference#i18ncontent).

**Note**: the default locale used in the components will be `en`. No other translations are provided out-of-the-box.

```jsx
import { KnockProvider } from "@knocklabs/react";

const YourAppLayout = () => {
  return (
    <KnockProvider
      apiKey={process.env.KNOCK_PUBLIC_API_KEY}
      userId={currentUser.id}
      i18n={{
        translations: {
          notifications: "Notifs",
          markAllAsRead: "Mark all as read!",
        },
        locale: "en",
      }}
    />
  );
};
```

### Filtering/scoping a feed

A feed can be scoped by any of the parameters that are accepted on the [feed endpoint](/api-reference/users/feeds/list_items) via the `FeedClientOptions` set in the `defaultFeedOptions` for the `KnockFeedProvider` component, or via the `useNotifications` hook.

#### Status filtering

The NotificationFeed component provides built-in support for filtering notifications by status (e.g., All, Unread). You can set the initial filter status using the `initialFilterStatus` prop:

```jsx
import { NotificationFeed, FilterStatus } from "@knocklabs/react";

<NotificationFeed initialFilterStatus={FilterStatus.Unread} />;
```

The component manages its filter state internally and provides a default header with status filtering controls. If you need to customize the status filtering behavior, you can provide a custom header using the `renderHeader` prop.

You can read more in this [guide on feed filtering](/in-app-ui/react/filtering-in-app-feeds).
