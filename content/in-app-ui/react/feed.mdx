Our `@knocklabs/react` library comes pre-built with a real-time feed component that you can drop into your application. In this guide, you'll find common recipes to help you work with the pre-built Knock feed UI element.

[See a live demo of our pre-built in-app feed UI element ->](https://in-app-demo.knock.app/)

  className="mx-auto border border-gray-200"
  style={{ borderRadius: "var(--tgph-rounded-5)" }}
/>

## Getting started

To use this example, you'll need [an account on Knock](https://dashboard.knock.app), as well as an in-app feed channel with a workflow that produces in-app feed messages. You'll also need:

- A public API key for the Knock environment (set as `KNOCK_PUBLIC_API_KEY`)
- The channel ID for the in-app feed (set as `KNOCK_FEED_CHANNEL_ID`)

<Callout

  title="Find your channel ID."
  text={
    <>
      To find the channel ID for your in-app channel(s), go to{" "}
      <span className="font-bold">Integrations</span> {">"}{" "}
      <span className="font-bold">Channels</span> in the Knock dashboard,
      navigate to the channel page of your in-app channel, and copy the channel
      ID.
    </>
  }
/>

## Installing dependencies

```bash title="Installing dependencies"
npm install @knocklabs/react
```

## Rendering the component

To add a real-time notifications feed to your product, you can use the out-of-the-box components that the `@knocklabs/react` library offers.

<Callout

  title="Secure your feed"
  text={
    <>
      By default, Knock feeds are accessible to anyone who has the feed ID. This makes it
      easy to get started in development. To secure your feed for production,
      enable enhanced security mode in your Knock dashboard and pass a signed
      {" "}<code>userToken</code> as a prop to the <code>KnockFeedProvider</code> component.

      For more information, visit <a href="/in-app-ui/security-and-authentication">the security & authentication guide</a>{" "}
      for client-side applications.
    </>

}
/>

```jsx
import { useState, useRef } from "react";
import {
  KnockProvider,
  KnockFeedProvider,
  NotificationIconButton,
  NotificationFeedPopover,
} from "@knocklabs/react";

// Required CSS import, unless you're overriding the styling
import "@knocklabs/react/dist/index.css";

const YourAppLayout = () => {
  const [isVisible, setIsVisible] = useState(false);
  const notifButtonRef = useRef(null);

  return (
    <KnockProvider
      apiKey={process.env.KNOCK_PUBLIC_API_KEY}
      user={{ id: user.id }}
    >
      <KnockFeedProvider feedId={process.env.KNOCK_FEED_CHANNEL_ID}>
        <>
          <NotificationIconButton
            ref={notifButtonRef}
            onClick={(e) => setIsVisible(!isVisible)}
          />
          <NotificationFeedPopover
            buttonRef={notifButtonRef}
            isVisible={isVisible}
            onClose={() => setIsVisible(false)}
          />
        </>
      </KnockFeedProvider>
    </KnockProvider>
  );
};
```

## UI/UX overrides

### Notification cell

You can customize the rendering of a notification cell in the feed by overriding the `renderItem` prop.

```jsx
import { NotificationFeed } from "@knocklabs/react";

const MyNotificationCell = ({ item, onItemClick }) => <Outer>...</Outer>;

<NotificationFeed renderItem={(props) => <MyNotificationCell {...props} />} />;
```

For more advanced use cases, you may need to render custom components as part of the notification cell, but don't need to override the cell entirely. For this use case, you can use the `children` prop to render custom components inside the notification cell.

```jsx
import { NotificationFeed, NotificationCell } from "@knocklabs/react";

<NotificationFeed
  renderItem={({ item, ...props }) => (
    <NotificationCell {...props} item={item}>
      <MyCustomComponent />
    </NotificationCell>
  )}
/>;
```

### Notification cell avatar

You can customize the `Avatar` component rendered within the `NotificationCell` by passing a different `avatar` component into the `NotificationCell` in the `renderItem` function passed to the feed:

```jsx
import { NotificationFeed, NotificationCell, Avatar } from "@knocklabs/react";

<NotificationFeed
  renderItem={({ item, ...props }) => (
    <NotificationCell
      {...props}
      item={item}
      // You can use any properties available on the `actor` for the name and avatar
      avatar={<Avatar name={item.actors[0].name} src={item.actors[0].avatar} />}
    />
  )}
/>;
```

### Notification icon button

You can update the notification icon to use `read` instead of `seen` for its badge count.

```jsx
import { NotificationIconButton } from "@knocklabs/react";

<NotificationIconButton onClick={...} badgeCountType="unread" />;
```

### Dark mode

The feed supports an optional `colorMode` prop, that defaults to `light` but can be set as `dark` for dark mode support.

```jsx
import { KnockFeedProvider } from "@knocklabs/react";

<KnockFeedProvider colorMode="dark" />;
```

### CSS customization

You can customize the appearance of the feed components in two main ways:

1. **CSS variables**: The feed uses CSS variables, which you can override to align with your product's design. Check the [theme.css source code](https://github.com/knocklabs/javascript/blob/main/packages/react/src/theme.css) for available variables.

2. **Custom CSS**: You can completely replace the Knock CSS to tailor the feed's look. All feed classes are unique and start with `rnf-`. View the [component source code](https://github.com/knocklabs/javascript/tree/main/packages/react/src) for class details.

If you import the component's CSS styles, you can use [CSS variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties) to override most properties like colors and font sizes. These variables are prefixed with `--rnf-`. Refer to the [theme.css file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/knocklabs/javascript/main/packages/react/src/theme.css) for a complete list.

## Handling interactivity

### Redirect to a URL

You can pass a value in the Action URL field of your notification template and the `KnockFeedProvider` will attach a redirect handler if `action_url` is not empty.

### Add an `onClick` handler

You can customize the click handler for the notification cell as follows:

```jsx
import { NotificationFeed } from "@knocklabs/react";

<NotificationFeed onNotificationClick={(item) => onClose()} />;
```

Both the `NotificationFeed` and the `NotificationFeedPopover` take a `onNotificationClick` prop.

### Add an `onButtonClick` handler

You can add a button click handler to respond to clicks on the buttons in the notification cell. The `onNotificationButtonClick` prop is available on the `NotificationFeed` component:

```jsx
import { NotificationFeed } from "@knocklabs/react";

<NotificationFeed
  onNotificationButtonClick={(item, button) => doSomething()}
/>;
```

### Mark-as-read behavior

By default the feed will mark all items as seen when the feed popover opens. You can change this behavior to mark items as read.

```jsx
import { NotificationFeedPopover } from "@knocklabs/react";

const onOpen = ({ store, feedClient }) => {
  const unreadItems = store.items.filter((item) => !item.read_at);

  if (unreadItems.length > 0) {
    feedClient.markAsRead(unreadItems);
  }
};

<NotificationFeedPopover
  onOpen={onOpen}
  {...}
/>;
```

## Socket behavior options

### Cross-browser feed sync

The `Feed` optionally supports an `__experimentalCrossBrowserUpdates` option under the `defaultFeedOptions` which will opt into using a [BroadcastChannel](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/BroadcastChannel) to keep multiple browser viewing contexts (windows, tabs) in sync for the same user feed.

You can see a demo of this behavior here:

<div style={{ position: "relative", paddingBottom: "56.25%", height: 0 }}>
  <iframe
    src="https://www.loom.com/embed/2f6bcdd4f4e14f99b92e51a404be2563"
    frameBorder="0"
    allowFullScreen
    style={{
      position: "absolute",
      top: 0,
      left: 0,
      width: "100%",
      height: "100%",
    }}
  ></iframe>
</div>

### Auto disconnect when inactive

Optionally, you can configure the `Feed` to disconnect socket connections with inactive tabs after a brief delay. If the tab becomes active again, the socket will reconnect to continue receiving real-time updates.

```jsx title="Automatically manage socket connections"
import { KnockFeedProvider } from "@knocklabs/react";

<KnockFeedProvider
  defaultFeedOptions={{
    // Turn on the automatic connection manager
    auto_manage_socket_connection: true,
    // Optionally, customize the delay amount in milliseconds. Defaults to 2000ms or 2s
    auto_manage_socket_connection_delay: 2500,
  }}
/>;
```

## Localization

You can set custom translations for the components inside the feed by passing the `i18n` property to the `KnockProvider` component. You can provide a partial or full set of translations to be used [following the expected `I18nContent` type](/in-app-ui/react/sdk/reference#i18ncontent).

**Note**: the default locale used in the components will be `en`. No other translations are provided out-of-the-box.

```jsx
import { KnockProvider } from "@knocklabs/react";

const YourAppLayout = () => {
  return (
    <KnockProvider
      apiKey={process.env.KNOCK_PUBLIC_API_KEY}
      user={{ id: currentUser.id }}
      i18n={{
        translations: {
          notifications: "Notifs",
          markAllAsRead: "Mark all as read!",
        },
        locale: "en",
      }}
    />
  );
};
```

## Filtering/scoping a feed

A feed can be scoped by any of the parameters that are accepted on the [feed endpoint](/api-reference/users/feeds/list_items) via the `FeedClientOptions` set in the `defaultFeedOptions` for the `KnockFeedProvider` component, or via the `useNotifications` hook.

#### Status filtering

The NotificationFeed component provides built-in support for filtering notifications by status (e.g., All, Unread). You can set the initial filter status using the `initialFilterStatus` prop:

```jsx
import { NotificationFeed, FilterStatus } from "@knocklabs/react";

<NotificationFeed initialFilterStatus={FilterStatus.Unread} />;
```

The component manages its filter state internally and provides a default header with status filtering controls. If you need to customize the status filtering behavior, you can provide a custom header using the `renderHeader` prop.

You can read more in this [guide on feed filtering](/in-app-ui/react/filtering-in-app-feeds).
