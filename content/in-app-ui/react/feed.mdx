Our `@knocklabs/react-notification-feed` library comes pre-built with a real-time feed component that you can drop into your application. In this guide, you'll find common recipes to help you work with the Knock feed component.

[See a live demo](https://knock-in-app-notifications-react.vercel.app/)

**Quick links**:

- [`@knocklabs/react-notification-feed` library reference](/in-app-ui/react/reference)
- [`@knocklabs/client` library reference](/in-app-ui/javascript/reference)

## Getting started

To use this example, you'll need [an account on Knock](https://dashboard.knock.app), as well as an in-app feed channel with a workflow that produces in-app feed messages. You'll also need:

- A public API key for the Knock environment (set as `KNOCK_PUBLIC_API_KEY`)
- The channel ID for the in-app feed (set as `KNOCK_FEED_CHANNEL_ID`)

      <span className="font-bold">Find your channel ID.</span> To find the
      channel ID for your in-app channel(s), go to {"Integrations > Channels"}{" "}
      in the Knock dashboard, navigate to the channel page of your in-app
      channel, and copy the channel ID.
    </>
  }
/>

## Installing dependencies

```bash Installing dependencies
npm install @knocklabs/react-notification-feed
```

## Rendering a notification feed

To add a real-time notifications feed to your product, you can use the out-of-the-box components that the `@knocklabs/react-notification-feed` library offers.

```jsx
import { useState, useRef } from "react";
import {
  KnockFeedProvider,
  NotificationIconButton,
  NotificationFeedPopover,
} from "@knocklabs/react-notification-feed";

// Required CSS import, unless you're overriding the styling
import "@knocklabs/react-notification-feed/dist/index.css";

const YourAppLayout = () => {
  const [isVisible, setIsVisible] = useState(false);
  const notifButtonRef = useRef(null);

  return (
    <KnockFeedProvider
      apiKey={process.env.KNOCK_PUBLIC_API_KEY}
      feedId={process.env.KNOCK_FEED_CHANNEL_ID}
      userId={currentUser.id}
    >
      <>
        <NotificationIconButton
          ref={notifButtonRef}
          onClick={(e) => setIsVisible(!isVisible)}
        />
        <NotificationFeedPopover
          buttonRef={notifButtonRef}
          isVisible={isVisible}
          onClose={() => setIsVisible(false)}
        />
      </>
    </KnockFeedProvider>
  );
};
```

## Common recipes

### Adding an `onClick` handler to the notification cell

You can customize the click handler for the notification cell as follows:

```jsx
import { NotificationFeed } from "@knocklabs/react-notification-feed";

<NotificationFeed onNotificationClick={(item) => onClose()} />;
```

Both the `NotificationFeed` and the `NotificationFeedPopover` take a `onNotificationClick` prop.

#### Rendering a different notification cell in the feed

You can customize the rendering of a notification cell in the feed by overriding the `renderItem` prop.

```jsx
import { NotificationFeed } from "@knocklabs/react-notification-feed";

const MyNotificationCell = ({ item, onItemClick }) => <Outer>...</Outer>;

<NotificationFeed renderItem={(props) => <MyNotificationCell {...props} />} />;
```

### Overriding the avatar

You can customize the `Avatar` component rendered within the `NotificationCell` by passing a different `avatar` component into the `NotificationCell` in the `renderItem` function passed to the feed:

```jsx
import {
  NotificationFeed,
  NotificationCell,
  Avatar,
} from "@knocklabs/react-notification-feed";

<NotificationFeed
  renderItem={({ item, ...props }) => (
    <NotificationCell
      {...props}
      item={item}
      // You can use any properties available on the `actor` for the name and avatar
      avatar={<Avatar name={item.actors[0].name} src={item.actors[0].avatar} />}
    />
  )}
/>;
```

### Using `read` instead of `seen` for the badge count

```jsx
import { NotificationIconButton } from "@knocklabs/react-notification-feed";

<NotificationIconButton onClick={...} badgeCountType="unread" />;
```

### Marking messages as read on the popover opening

```jsx
import { NotificationFeedPopover } from "@knocklabs/react-notification-feed";

const onOpen = ({ store, feedClient }) => {
  const unreadItems = store.items.filter((item) => !item.read_at);

  if (unreadItems.length > 0) {
    feedClient.markAsRead(unreadItems);
  }
};

<NotificationFeedPopover
  onOpen={onOpen}
  {...}
/>;
```

### Using dark mode

The feed supports an optional `colorMode` prop, that defaults to `light` but can be set as `dark` for dark mode support.

```jsx
import { KnockFeedProvider } from "@knocklabs/react-notification-feed";

<KnockFeedProvider colorMode="dark" />;
```

### Adding inline actions

For more advanced use cases, you may need to provide inline actions on your notifications. The `NotificationCell` component accepts a `children` prop in order for you to render actions. You'll need to override the `renderItem` prop on the `NotificationFeed` or `NotificationFeedPopover` to render the custom notification cell.

#### Using action buttons

We ship `Button` and `ButtonGroup` components, which have a complementary set of styling for the rest of the feed. You can render the buttons in a button group so that they'll be grouped together, or can render them individually.

```jsx
import {
  ButtonGroup,
  Button,
  NotificationFeed,
  NotificationCell,
} from "@knocklabs/react-notification-feed";

<NotificationFeed
  renderItem={({ item, ...props }) => (
    <NotificationCell {...props} item={item}>
      <ButtonGroup>
        <Button variant="primary" onClick={myAcceptHandler}>
          Accept
        </Button>
        <Button variant="secondary" onClick={myRejectHandler}>
          Reject
        </Button>
      </ButtonGroup>
    </NotificationCell>
  )}
/>;
```

**Note**: remember to call `event.stopPropagation` in your `onClick` handler to stop the notification `onClick` handler from being invoked.

#### Targeting a specific workflow to have buttons

A common use case is to only show action buttons for certain workflows. You can achieve this via the `item.source` property, which exposes a `WorkflowSource`:

```jsx
import {
  ButtonGroup,
  Button,
  NotificationFeed,
  NotificationCell,
} from "@knocklabs/react-notification-feed";

<NotificationFeed
  renderItem={({ item, ...props }) => (
    <NotificationCell {...props} item={item}>
      {item.source.key === "approval-workflow" && (
        <ButtonGroup>
          <Button variant="primary">Accept</Button>
          <Button variant="secondary">Reject</Button>
        </ButtonGroup>
      )}
    </NotificationCell>
  )}
/>;
```

You can find a full list of the props available for the [`Button` component here](/in-app-ui/react/reference#button).

### Handling cross-browser feed synchronization

The `Feed` optionally supports an `__experimentalCrossBrowserUpdates` option under the `defaultFeedOptions` which will opt into using a [BroadcastChannel](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/BroadcastChannel) to keep multiple browser viewing contexts (windows, tabs) in sync for the same user feed.

You can see a demo of this behavior here:

<div style={{ position: "relative", paddingBottom: "56.25%", height: 0 }}>
  <iframe
    src="https://www.loom.com/embed/2f6bcdd4f4e14f99b92e51a404be2563"
    frameBorder="0"
    allowFullScreen
    style={{
      position: "absolute",
      top: 0,
      left: 0,
      width: "100%",
      height: "100%",
    }}
  ></iframe>
</div>

### Customizing the feed styling

The complete theme that controls the look and feel of the feed components can be customized for theme in a few different ways:

1. **Customizing the CSS variables**. The feed is written using CSS variables, which you can override to better match the look and feel of your product. The best way to see the possible CSS variables in use is to look at the [theme.css source code](https://github.com/knocklabs/react-notification-feed/blob/main/src/theme.css).

2. **Bringing your own CSS**. It's possible to override the Knock CSS entirely to customize the look and feel of the feed. All of the feed classes are unique and start with `rnf-`. You can see the classes in use by looking at the [source code of the components](https://github.com/knocklabs/react-notification-feed/blob/main/src/).

### Setting custom translations

You can set custom translations for the components inside the feed by passing the `i18n` property to the `KnockFeedProvider` component. You can provide a partial or full set of translations to be used [following the expected `I18nContent` type](/in-app-ui/react/reference#i18ncontent).

**Note**: the default locale used in the components will be `en`. No other translations are provided out-of-the-box.

```jsx
import { KnockFeedProvider } from "@knocklabs/react-notification-feed";

const YourAppLayout = () => {
  return (
    <KnockFeedProvider
      apiKey={process.env.KNOCK_PUBLIC_API_KEY}
      feedId={process.env.KNOCK_FEED_CHANNEL_ID}
      userId={currentUser.id}
      i18n={{
        translations: {
          notifications: "Notifs",
          markAllAsRead: "Mark all as read!",
        },
        locale: "en",
      }}
    />
  );
};
```

### Filtering/scoping a feed

A feed can be scoped by any of the parameters that are accepted on the [feed endpoint](/reference#get-feed) via the `FeedClientOptions` set in the `defaultFeedOptions` for the `KnockFeedProvider` component, or via the `useNotifications` hook.

You can read more in this [guide on feed filtering](/guides/filtering-in-app-feeds).
