Our `@knocklabs/react` library can be used to build full-page inbox experiences, too. This page covers how to create a basic inbox for your users in just a few minutes.

## Getting started

To use this example, you'll need [an account on Knock](https://dashboard.knock.app), as well as an in-app feed channel with a workflow that produces in-app feed messages. You'll also need:

- A public API key for the Knock environment (set as `KNOCK_PUBLIC_API_KEY`)
- The channel ID for the in-app feed (set as `KNOCK_FEED_CHANNEL_ID`)

<Callout

  title="Find your channel ID."
  text={
    <>
      To find the channel ID for your in-app channel(s), go to{" "}
      <span className="font-bold">Integrations</span> {">"}{" "}
      <span className="font-bold">Channels</span> in the Knock dashboard,
      navigate to the channel page of your in-app channel, and copy the channel
      ID.
    </>
  }
/>

## Installing dependencies

```bash title="Installing dependencies"
npm install @knocklabs/react
```

## Rendering the notification inbox

Here we're using the `KnockProvider` to authenticate our current user and get access to the Knock JavaScript client. Then we use the `KnockFeedProvider` to connect them to a Knock In-app Feed Channel. We then render the `NotificationFeed` component to give us a simple, complete notification inbox page.

```jsx
import { KnockFeedProvider, NotificationFeed } from "@knocklabs/react";

const NotificationInbox = () => {
  // An example of fetching the current authenticated user
  const { user } = useCurrentUser();

  return (
    <KnockProvider
      apiKey={process.env.KNOCK_PUBLIC_API_KEY}
      user={{ id: user.id }}
    >
      {/* Optionally, use the KnockFeedProvider to connect an in-app feed */}
      <KnockFeedProvider feedId={process.env.KNOCK_FEED_ID}>
        <NotificationFeed />
      </KnockFeedProvider>
    </KnockProvider>
  );
};
```
