Using our `@knocklabs/react` and `@knocklabs/client` libraries, you can create fully custom notification UIs that are backed by the Knock Feed API and real-time service.

In this guide, we'll take a look at creating a completely custom notifications UI in our application in a headless way using Knock's hooks.

## Getting started

To use this example, you'll need [an account on Knock](https://dashboard.knock.app), as well as an in-app feed channel with a workflow that produces in-app feed messages. You'll also need:

- A public API key for the Knock environment (set as `KNOCK_PUBLIC_API_KEY`)
- The channel ID for the in-app feed (set as `KNOCK_FEED_CHANNEL_ID`)

<Callout

      To find the channel ID for your in-app channel(s), go to{" "}
      <span className="font-bold">Integrations</span> {">"}{" "}
      <span className="font-bold">Channels</span> in the Knock dashboard,
      navigate to the channel page of your in-app channel, and copy the channel
      ID.
    </>
  }
/>

## Installing dependencies

```bash title="Installing dependencies"
npm install @knocklabs/react
```

## Implement `KnockProvider`

First, we'll need to implement the `KnockProvider` component somewhere in your component tree and authenticate against the Knock API using a user id and API key.

```jsx title="Implement KnockProvider in your app"
import { KnockProvider } from "@knocklabs/react";

const App = ({ user }) => (
  <KnockProvider
    apiKey={process.env.KNOCK_PUBLIC_API_KEY}
    user={{ id: user.id }}
  >
    <NotificationFeed />
  </KnockProvider>
);
```

## Setup the Knock client

Next, we'll need to access the instance of the Knock client created by the `KnockProvider` using the `useKnockClient` hook.

```jsx title="Access the configured knockClient using useKnockClient"
import { useKnockClient } from "@knocklabs/react";

const NotificationFeed = ({ user }) => {
  const knockClient = useKnockClient();

  return null;
};
```

## Setup the Knock feed instance

Next, we'll want to set up an instance of a Knock Feed, which will handle the state management and provide a way for us to interact with the messages on the feed.

```jsx title="Create a feed store with Zustand"
import {
  useKnockClient,
  useNotifications,
  useNotificationStore,
} from "@knocklabs/react";
import { useEffect } from "react";

const NotificationFeed = ({ user }) => {
  const knockClient = useKnockClient();
  const feedClient = useNotifications(
    knockClient,
    process.env.KNOCK_FEED_CHANNEL_ID,
  );

  const { items, metadata } = useNotificationStore(feedClient);

  useEffect(() => {
    feedClient.fetch();
  }, [feedClient]);

  return null;
};
```

## Creating a custom notifications UI

The last step is to render our notifications UI using the data that's exposed via the state store (`items` and `metadata`).

```jsx title="Render items and metadata in the feed"
import {
  useKnockClient,
  useNotifications,
  useNotificationStore,
} from "@knocklabs/react";
import { useEffect } from "react";

const NotificationFeed = ({ user }) => {
  const knockClient = useKnockClient();
  const feedClient = useNotifications(
    knockClient,
    process.env.KNOCK_FEED_CHANNEL_ID,
  );

  const { items, metadata } = useNotificationStore(feedClient);

  useEffect(() => {
    feedClient.fetch();
  }, [feedClient]);

  return (
    <div className="notifications">
      <span>You have {metadata.unread_count} unread items</span>

      {items.map((item) => (
        <div key={item.id}>
          <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: item.blocks[0].rendered }} />
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
};
```

## Wrapping up

There's a lot more we can do with our notifications UI, but we'll leave that as an exercise to the reader. Here are some examples:

- Adding mark as read, and archiving behavior to the notification cell
- Displaying a count of the total number of notifications
