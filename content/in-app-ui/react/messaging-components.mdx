Using our React SDK, it's possible to create in-app messaging experiences either using our pre-built components, or by building your own custom components on top of custom [in-app message types](/in-app-ui/message-types).

Note: this guide assumes that already have a Knock account with a configured in-app channel. If you haven't yet signed up for Knock, you can do so [here](https://dashboard.knock.app/signup).

## Using our pre-built components

The React library (`@knocklabs/react`) provides pre-built components that map to our out-of-the-box message types for `banner`, `card`, and `modal`.

You can use these components by dropping them into your application where ever youâ€™d like them to display.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Setup the KnockProvider and KnockInAppMessagesChannelProvider">
    The `KnockProvider` is a React context provider that makes the Knock client SDK available to your application. The `KnockInAppMessagesChannelProvider` is a React context provider that makes the Knock in-app messages client in to your application.

```tsx
import { KnockProvider, KnockInAppMessagesChannelProvider } from "@knocklabs/react";

const MyApp = () => {
  return (
    <KnockProvider publicKey={process.env.KNOCK_PUBLIC_KEY} userId={currentUser.id}>
      <KnockInAppMessagesChannelProvider channelId={process.env.KNOCK_IAM_CHANNEL_ID}>
        <MyAppLayout>
      </KnockInAppMessagesChannelProvider>
    </KnockProvider>
  );
}
```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Mount one or more pre-built components">
    Mount one or more of the pre-built components (`<Banner />`, `<Card />`, `<Modal />`) under the `KnockInAppMessagesChannelProvider` in your application tree.

```tsx
import { Banner, KnockProvider, KnockInAppMessagesChannelProvider } from "@knocklabs/react";

const MyApp = () => {
  return (
    <KnockProvider publicKey={process.env.KNOCK_PUBLIC_KEY} userId={currentUser.id}>
      <KnockInAppMessagesChannelProvider>
        <MyAppLayout>
        <Banner />
      </KnockInAppMessagesChannelProvider>
    </KnockProvider>
  );
}
```

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Building custom components

In addition to the pre-built components, you can also write custom messaging components on top of our hooks and data layer. This makes it possible for you to create custom message types, and build custom messaging UI experiences, all powered by Knock's infrastructure.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a custom message type (optional)">
    If you'd like to create a custom message type, you can do so by following the guide on [creating custom message types](/in-app-ui/message-types).

    Otherwise, you can create a custom component on top of the out-of-the-box message types that Knock provides.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Setup the KnockProvider and KnockInAppMessagesChannelProvider">
    The `KnockProvider` is a React context provider that makes the Knock client SDK available to your application. The `KnockInAppMessagesChannelProvider` is a React context provider that makes the Knock in-app messages client in to your application.

```tsx
const MyApp = () => {
  return (
    <KnockProvider publicKey={process.env.KNOCK_PUBLIC_KEY} userId={currentUser.id}>
      <KnockInAppMessagesChannelProvider channelId={process.env.KNOCK_IAM_CHANNEL_ID}>
        <MyAppLayout>
      </KnockInAppMessagesChannelProvider>
    </KnockProvider>
  );
}
```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a custom messaging component">
    Create a custom messaging component that uses the `useInAppMessage` or `useInAppMessages` hook to render one or more in-app messages.

```tsx
import { useInAppMessage } from "@knocklabs/react";

const MyBanner = () => {
  const { message, inAppMessagesClient } = useInAppMessage("my-custom-banner");

  if (!message) return null;

  const onBannerClick = async () => {
    await inAppMessagesClient.markAsInteracted(message);
    router.push(actionUrl);
  };

  return (
    <div onClick={onBannerClick} role="button" className="my-banner">
      {message.content.body}
    </div>
  );
};
```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Mount your component">
    Mount your component under the `KnockInAppMessagesChannelProvider` in your application tree. You can mount your component anywhere in the tree, but it must be a descendant of the `KnockInAppMessagesChannelProvider`.

```tsx
const MyApp = () => {
  return (
    <KnockProvider publicKey={process.env.KNOCK_PUBLIC_KEY} userId={currentUser.id}>
      <KnockInAppMessagesChannelProvider>
        <MyAppLayout>
        <MyBanner />
      </KnockInAppMessagesChannelProvider>
    </KnockProvider>
  );
}
```

  </Step>
</Steps>
