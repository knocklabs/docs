You can create a new Sinch MessageMedia channel in the dashboard under the **Channels and sources** tab in your account settings. From there, you'll need to configure the channel for each environment you have.

## Channel configuration

The following channel settings should be configured per [environment](/concepts/environments). Navigate to **Channels and sources** in your dashboard account settings, select your Sinch MessageMedia [channel](/concepts/channels), then click "Manage configuration" under the environment that you'd like to configure.
