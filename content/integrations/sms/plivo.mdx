Knock integrates with <a href="https://www.plivo.com/" target="_blank">Plivo</a> to send SMS notifications to your recipients.

## Features

- Delivery tracking
- Knock link tracking
- Per environment configuration
- Sandbox mode

## Getting started

You can create a new Plivo channel in the dashboard under the **Channels and sources** page in your account settings. From there, you'll need to take the following steps in Plivo before you can configure your channel within Knock.

<Steps titleSize="h3">
  <Step title="Create a Plivo account">
    <a href="https://console.plivo.com/accounts/register/" target="_blank">Sign up</a> for a Plivo account if you haven't already. 
    
    After doing this you will gain access to your dashboard where you can find your **Auth ID** and **Auth Token**.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify a phone number">
    You can add a <a href="https://console.plivo.com/phone-numbers/sandbox-numbers/" target="_blank">sandbox number</a> for testing, or you can buy a <a href="https://console.plivo.com/active-phone-numbers/" target="_blank">Plivo phone number</a> to use as the from field on your Knock channel.
  
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configuring Plivo in Knock">
    Now that you have your **verified phone number**, **Auth ID** and **Auth Token**, you're ready to configure your Plivo channel in the Knock dashboard under the **Channels and sources** page in your account settings.
  
  </Step>
