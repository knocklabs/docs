        MessageBird announced a rebrand as Bird
      </a>
      , along with the introduction of a Bird CRM product and new APIs for sending
      messages. <br /> <br /> This integration is with the <a

        target="_blank"
      >
        legacy MessageBird SMS API
      </a>, which continues to be supported by Bird but is no longer accepting new
      customers. If integrating with the new Bird API is a blocker to your Knock
      integration, please reach out to <a href="mailto:support@knock.app?subject=Bird%20API%20integration">

You can create a new MessageBird channel in the dashboard under the **Channels and sources** tab in your account settings. From there, you'll need to configure the channel for each environment you have.

## Channel configuration

The following channel settings should be configured per [environment](/concepts/environments). Navigate to **Channels and sources** in your dashboard account settings, select your MessageBird [channel](/concepts/channels), then click "Manage configuration" under the environment that you'd like to configure.

## Recipient data requirements

In order to send an SMS notification you'll need a valid `phone_number` property set on your recipient.
