## Getting started

You can create a new Sinch channel in the dashboard under the **Channels and sources** page in your account settings. From there, you'll need to configure the channel for each environment you have.

## Channel configuration

The following channel settings should be configured per [environment](/concepts/environments). Navigate to **Channels and sources** in your dashboard account settings, select your Sinch [channel](/concepts/channels), then click "Manage configuration" under the environment that you'd like to configure.
