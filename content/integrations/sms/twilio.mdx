Knock integrates with [Twilio](https://twilio.com/) to send SMS notifications to your recipients.

## Features

- Delivery tracking
- Per environment configuration
- Sandbox mode

## Getting started

We'll walk through a few steps to take in Twilio before jumping into how to configure Twilio within Knock.

### Twilio setup

Before you set up your Twilio SMS channel in Knock, you'll need to take the following steps in Twilio.

1. [Sign up](https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio) for a Twilio account if you haven't already.
2. [Get your first SMS-enabled phone number](https://www.twilio.com/docs/usage/tutorials/how-to-use-your-free-trial-account#get-your-first-twilio-phone-number) in Twilio. You'll use this as the "from" phone number in your channel configuration within Knock. (We also support Twilio [short codes](https://www.twilio.com/sms/short-codes) and [messaging services](https://www.twilio.com/docs/messaging/services), but we won't be covering those in this guide.)
3. If you're Twilio account is in trial mode, you'll need to [pre-verify any phone numbers with Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/docs/usage/tutorials/how-to-use-your-free-trial-account#verify-your-personal-phone-number) that you plan to send to from Knock during testing.

Once you've completed those steps, you're ready to start sending SMS notifications with Knock.

### Configure Twilio in Knock

You can create your Twilio channel under the **Integrations** > **Channels** page in the Knock dashboard. Once the channel has been created, you'll need to configure each of your Knock environments to work with Twilio.

Each environment requires a Twilio account ID, an auth token, and a "from" resource within Twilio from which to send messages. This "from" resource can be a Twilio phone number, short code, or messaging service. (If you are using a phone number, keep in mind that all numbers used in Knock must be in [E.164 format](https://www.twilio.com/docs/glossary/what-e164).)

## Recipient data requirements

In order to send an SMS notification you'll need a valid `phone_number` property set on your recipient.
