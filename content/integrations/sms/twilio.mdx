## Features

- Delivery tracking

## Getting started

You can create a new Twilio channel in the dashboard under the **Integrations** > **Channels** section. From there, you'll need to take some steps in Twilio before you can configure your Twilio channel within Knock.

<Steps titleSize="h3">
  <Step title="Sign up for Twilio">
    <a href="https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio" target="_blank">Sign up</a> for a Twilio account if you haven't already.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Get a Twilio phone number">
    <a href="https://www.twilio.com/docs/messaging/guides/how-to-use-your-free-trial-account#get-your-free-twilio-phone-number" target="_blank">Get your first SMS-enabled phone number</a> in Twilio. You'll use this as the "From" phone number in your channel configuration within Knock.

    (We also support Twilio <a href="https://www.twilio.com/sms/short-codes" target="_blank">short codes</a> and <a href="https://www.twilio.com/docs/messaging/services" target="_blank">messaging services</a>.)

  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify phone numbers (trial accounts only)">
    If your Twilio account is in trial mode, you'll need to <a href="https://www.twilio.com/docs/messaging/guides/how-to-use-your-free-trial-account#appendix-one-adding-more-verified-personal-phone-numbers-to-your-account" target="_blank">pre-verify any phone numbers</a> that you plan to send SMS messages to during testing with Knock.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configuring Twilio in Knock">

## Recipient data requirements

In order to send an SMS notification you'll need a valid `phone_number` property set on your recipient.

## Delivery tracking

Delivery tracking for Twilio can result in the following status updates to your message:

- The message delivery is confirmed and Knock updates the message to `delivered`
- The message was not delivered due to bad recipient(s) and Knock updates the message to `bounced`
- The message was not delivered due to an error reported by Twilio and Knock updates the message to `undelivered`
