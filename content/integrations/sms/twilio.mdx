Knock integrates with <a href="https://twilio.com/" target="_blank">Twilio</a> to send SMS notifications to your recipients.

## Features

- Delivery tracking
- Bounce Support
- Knock link tracking
- Per environment configuration
- Sandbox mode

## Getting started

You can create a new Twilio channel in the dashboard under the **Channels and sources** page in your account settings. From there, you'll need to take some steps in Twilio before you can configure your Twilio channel within Knock.

<Steps titleSize="h3">
  <Step title="Sign up for Twilio">
    <a href="https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio" target="_blank">Sign up</a> for a Twilio account if you haven't already.

  <Step title="Get a Twilio phone number">

    (We also support Twilio <a href="https://www.twilio.com/sms/short-codes" target="_blank">short codes</a> and <a href="https://www.twilio.com/docs/messaging/services" target="_blank">messaging services</a>.)

  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify phone numbers (trial accounts only)">
    If your Twilio account is in trial mode, you'll need to <a href="https://www.twilio.com/docs/messaging/guides/how-to-use-your-free-trial-account#appendix-one-adding-more-verified-personal-phone-numbers-to-your-account" target="_blank">pre-verify any phone numbers</a> that you plan to send SMS messages to during testing with Knock.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configuring Twilio in Knock">
    Now that you have your **Twilio phone number**, **account ID** and **auth token**, you're ready to configure your Twilio channel in the Knock dashboard under the **Channels and sources** page in your account settings.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Channel configuration

The following channel settings should be configured per [environment](/concepts/environments). Navigate to **Channels and sources** in your dashboard account settings, select your Twilio [channel](/concepts/channels), then click "Manage configuration" under the environment that you'd like to configure.

## Recipient data requirements

In order to send an SMS notification you'll need a valid `phone_number` property set on your recipient.

## Delivery status webhooks

When enabled, Twilio will send delivery status updates directly to Knock via webhooks, allowing you to track the full lifecycle of your SMS messages in real-time.

### Prerequisites

Before enabling delivery status webhooks, you need:

1. A Twilio account with an SMS-enabled phone number, short code, or messaging service
2. A Twilio channel configured in Knock (see the [getting started](#getting-started) section above)
3. Access to your Twilio phone number or messaging service configuration

### Setting up delivery status webhooks

<Steps titleSize="h3">
  <Step title="Enable delivery status webhooks in Knock">
    1. Navigate to **Channels and sources** in your Knock dashboard
    2. Select your Twilio channel
    3. Click "Manage configuration" for the environment you want to configure
    4. Scroll to the "Incoming message status updates" section and enable incoming webhooks
    5. Copy the generated webhook URL - you'll need this in the next step
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure status callback in Twilio">
    The setup process depends on whether you're using a phone number/short code or a messaging service:

    **For phone numbers or short codes:**

    1. Go to the [Phone Numbers](https://console.twilio.com/us1/develop/phone-numbers/manage/incoming) page in your Twilio Console
    2. Select the phone number or short code you're using with Knock
    3. Scroll to the "Messaging" section
    4. Under "Status Callback URL", paste the webhook URL from Knock
    5. Click "Save" to apply the changes

    **For messaging services:**

    1. Go to the [Messaging Services](https://console.twilio.com/us1/develop/sms/services) page in your Twilio Console
    2. Select the messaging service you're using with Knock
    3. Go to the "Integration" settings
    4. Under "Status Callback URL", paste the webhook URL from Knock
    5. Click "Save" to apply the changes

  </Step>
</Steps>

### Supported delivery statuses

When delivery status webhooks are enabled for Twilio, Knock will update message statuses based on these Twilio status callback events:

| Twilio Status | Knock Status  | Description                                                     |
| ------------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| delivered     | `delivered`   | The SMS was successfully delivered to the recipient's device    |
| failed        | `bounced`     | The SMS failed due to invalid phone number or carrier rejection |
| undelivered   | `undelivered` | The SMS could not be delivered due to a temporary error         |

### Troubleshooting

If delivery status updates aren't appearing in Knock:

1. **Check status callback URL.** Verify the Status Callback URL is correctly configured in your Twilio phone number or messaging service settings.
2. **Verify phone number format.** Ensure recipients have valid phone numbers in E.164 format (e.g., +1234567890).
3. **Check trial account limits.** If using a trial account, verify the recipient phone number has been verified in Twilio.
4. **Review Twilio logs.** Check the Messaging Logs in Twilio Console to see if messages are being sent and if status callbacks are being triggered.
5. **Test with a real number.** Send a test SMS to a real phone number to verify the full delivery flow.
