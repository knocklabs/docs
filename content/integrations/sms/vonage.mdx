Knock integrates with <a href="https://vonage.com/" target="_blank">Vonage</a> to send SMS notifications to your recipients.

## Features

- Knock link tracking
- Per environment configuration
- Sandbox mode

## Getting started

You can create a new Vonage channel in the dashboard under the **Channels and sources** tab in your account settings. From there, you'll need to configure the channel for each environment you have.

## Channel configuration

The following channel settings should be configured per [environment](/concepts/environments). Navigate to **Channels and sources** in your dashboard account settings, select your Vonage [channel](/concepts/channels), then click "Manage configuration" under the environment that you'd like to configure.
