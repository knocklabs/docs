Knock integrates with <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sns/" target="_blank">AWS Simple Notification Service (SNS)</a> to send SMS notifications to your recipients.

## Features

- Knock link tracking
- Per environment configuration
- Sandbox mode

## Getting started

You can create a new AWS SNS channel in the dashboard under the **Channels and sources** page in your account settings. From there, you'll need to take some steps in AWS before you can configure your SNS channel within Knock.

<Steps titleSize="h3">
  <Step title="Choose an AWS Authentication Scheme">
    Knock supports two authentication schemes with AWS SNS:
    
    <AccordionGroup>
      <Accordion title="Option 1: Create an AWS IAM User with security credentials">
        To send notifications via AWS SNS using an IAM User, Knock requires the **access key ID** and a **secret access key** of an AWS user with SNS send permissions (you can use the `sns:AmazonSNSFullAccess` permission for this).

        If you don't already have a user with send permissions, you can create an IAM user in AWS to use with the Knock API. You can learn more about creating IAM users in AWS <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-setting-up.html#create-iam-user" target="_blank">here</a>.

        Once you've created your new IAM user, you'll need to provision them with the policy below.

        ```json title="IAM user policy"
        {
          "Version": "2012-10-17",
          "Statement": [
            {
              "Effect": "Allow",
              "Action": ["sns:AmazonSNSFullAccess"],
              "Resource": "*"
            }
          ]
        }
        ```

        Now that you have an AWS user created and provisioned with SNS send access, grab the **access key ID** and a **secret access key** of the user—we'll use these later when configuring the SNS channel within Knock.
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="Option 2: Create an AWS IAM Role with a trust policy for Knock">
        To send notifications via AWS SNS by <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_common-scenarios_third-party.html" target="_blank">delegating an IAM Role</a> in your AWS account to Knock, <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-user_externalid.html" target="_blank">secured with an External ID</a>:

        1. Create a new AWS Role:

           - For "Trusted Entity Type" choose "AWS Account."
           - Select "Another AWS account" and put "496685847699" in the Account ID.
           - Check "Require external ID" and enter the ID of the SNS channel you created in your Knock dashboard.

          className="rounded-md mx-auto border border-gray-200"
          alt="How Knock works diagram"
        />

        2. Attach the following permission policy to that role.

           ```json title="IAM user policy"
           {
             "Version": "2012-10-17",
             "Statement": [
               {
                 "Effect": "Allow",
                 "Action": ["sns:AmazonSNSFullAccess"],
                 "Resource": "*"
               }
             ]
           }
           ```

        3. Use that role's ARN when configuring your AWS SNS channel in Knock.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Configuring SNS in Knock">
    Now that you have either an AWS User's credentials or an AWS IAM Role to delegate to Knock, you're ready to [configure your SNS channel](#channel-configuration) in the Knock dashboard under the **Channels and sources** page in your account settings.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Here are a few other things to keep in mind once you have your SNS channel configured in Knock:

- **SNS sandbox mode.** By default, AWS places all new accounts in the SNS sandbox. While your account is in the sandbox, you can only send messages to verified destination phone numbers—keep this in mind if you're testing in development before you've moved your account out of the SNS sandbox. For more information on the SNS sandbox and how to move your account out of it, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-sms-sandbox-moving-to-production.html" target="_blank">SNS sandbox documentation</a>.
- **Deliverability tracking.** We cannot currently track deliverability through SNS channels. This means that all notifications sent through SNS will show up as "Sent" in the Knock messages log, but not "Delivered".

## Channel configuration

The following channel settings should be configured per [environment](/concepts/environments). Navigate to **Channels and sources** in your dashboard account settings, select your AWS SNS [channel](/concepts/channels), then click "Manage configuration" under the environment that you'd like to configure.

## Recipient data requirements

In order to send an SMS notification you'll need a valid `phone_number` property set on your recipient.
