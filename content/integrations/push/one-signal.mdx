In this guide we'll walk through how to configure a OneSignal provider in Knock to send push notifications. This guide assumes that you've already created a OneSignal channel in the Knock dashboard.

Your OneSignal channel expects that you are using Knock to author Push notification templates. Those templates are then passed to OneSignal as content.

## How to configure OneSignal Push with Knock

      this guide assumes that you have already setup OneSignal with push
      certificates and everything needed in order to start sending push
      notifications. You should also have already integrated the OneSignal SDK
      within your application.
    </>
  }
/>

To set up OneSignal Push with Knock you will need:

- Your OneSignal App ID
- Your OneSignal API Key for sending notifications
- To select a mode of operation between using `external_ids` (recommended) or `player_ids` (deprecated by OneSignal).

## Using OneSignal Push with Knock

### Using `external_id` (recommended)

If you're using an <a href="https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/users#external-id" target="_blank">External ID</a> to reference your OneSignal users within Knock, you do not need to supply any additional data to initiate a request. We will automatically pass your Knock user ID to OneSignal as the `external_id`.

### Using `player_id`

When using <a href="https://documentation.onesignal.com/v9.0/docs/users#player-id" target="_blank">Player IDs</a> you will need to store the `player_id` for a user within Knock as ChannelData for the OneSignal Push channel. This ensures that Knock has the correct value to pass to send a notification to a recipient when a workflow is triggered.

You can retrieve the `player_id` from OneSignal once a user has been registered, either by using the OneSignal mobile SDK, or by using a webhook from OneSignal.

## Data passed to OneSignal

When sending a push notification to OneSignal, we will automatically pass the following into the attachments data:

| Property           | Type   | Description                                            |
| ------------------ | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| knock_message_id\* | string | The message ID of the corresponding Knock message      |
| data \*            | string | Any key/value data passed through in your trigger call |

## Silent/background notifications

When selecting to send as a silent/background notification, Knock will passthrough the content_available=true option to OneSignal. You can enable this per push notification template by clicking the gear icon (‚öôÔ∏è) at the top of the template editor to open the template settings modal.

## Using overrides to customize notifications

We have full support for overriding the payload sent to OneSignal for adding things like badge counts, extra data properties, and sound files. To set push overrides, click the gear icon (‚öôÔ∏è) at the top of the template editor to open the template settings modal. Push overrides support Liquid for injecting `data` properties and referencing attributes on your recipients.

Overrides are merged into the notification payload sent to OneSignal. See the <a href="https://documentation.onesignal.com/reference/push-notification" target="_blank">OneSignal documentation for more details</a>. Knock uses the "Aliases" targeting strategy to send push notifications to specific users via External ID.

## Managing tokens

By default, Knock makes no assumptions about managing your device tokens. This means you are responsible for removing tokens when a recipient opts out of notifications on a device or when their token expires.

When using `player_id` mode, Knock provides an opt-in token deregistration feature that automatically removes invalid tokens from a recipient's channel data when a message bounces. This feature is not available when using `external_id` mode since Knock doesn't directly manage any tokens in this case.

You can configure token deregistration on a per-environment basis in your channel's environment configurations. See our [token deregistration guide](/integrations/push/token-deregistration) for more details.

## Channel data requirements

When your OneSignal push channel is configured to use `player_ids` you must supply ChannelData per-recipient that contains one or more `player_ids` for a user.

## Frequently asked questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I use both `player_ids` and `external_ids` for my OneSignal integration?">
    No, you can currently only use one or the other.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I use a different identifier as an `external_id`?">
    Currently this is not supported but we'd love to hear a use case you have
    for it!
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I use a `template_id` stored in OneSignal?">
    Yes, you can use push overrides to override the JSON payload and specify the
    template_id for OneSignal instead.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I use the OneSignal Push integration to send email or SMS?">
    No, only Push is currently supported.
