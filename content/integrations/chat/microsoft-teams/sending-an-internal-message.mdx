In this guide we'll cover how to send a message to an internal Microsoft Teams workspace using Knock. It assumes that you have already created a Microsoft Teams channel in Knock as outlined in the [Microsoft Teams integration overview](/integrations/chat/microsoft-teams/overview) guide.

Here's what we'll cover in this guide:

- Retrieving an incoming webhook URL from Microsoft Teams
- Setting channel data for an `Object` in Knock
- Triggering a workflow with an object recipient to send a message to a Microsoft Teams channel

## Microsoft Teams channels are connections on Objects

In Knock, we model channels in a Microsoft Teams workspace as connections on Objects. [Objects](/concepts/objects) allow you to model any resource in your system within Knock, and while their primary purpose is to act as non-user recipients, they are very flexible abstractions.

### An overview of Objects

Individual Objects exist within [a collection](/concepts/objects#collection-naming) and always have [a unique ID](/concepts/objects#the-object-identifier) or key within that collection. The Object itself can store any number and type of properties as key-value pairs. You can see some examples of possible Object structures in [the official documentation on setting Object data](/concepts/objects#sending-object-data-to-knock).

Let’s say you are building a devtool product like GitHub and want to set up Microsoft Teams notifications whenever someone comments on an issue within a repository. First, you’ll want to create an Object to model your repository as part of the `repositories` collection:

```javascript
import { Knock } from "@knocklabs/node";
const knockClient = new Knock(process.env.KNOCK_API_KEY);

await knockClient.objects.set("repositories", "repo-1", {
  name: "My repo",
});
```

Once you have a repository object created, you can add the channel data for Microsoft Teams as a connection on the object.
