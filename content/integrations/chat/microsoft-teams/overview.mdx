In this guide you'll learn how to use Knock to send notifications to Microsoft Teams. Depending on your use case, there are a few different ways to approach this integration. This guide serves as a starting point and will cover the basics of setting up a Microsoft Teams integration with Knock regardless of your use case.

Here's what we'll cover in this guide.

- The different methods of sending notifications to Microsoft Teams
- How to add a Microsoft Teams channel to your Knock instance
- How to store Microsoft Teams connection data in Knock using channel data
- How to design notification templates for Teams

## Supported notification methods

Today, Knock supports sending notifications to Microsoft Teams using two different methods:

- Using an incoming webhook URL. This is suitable for [internal or one-off integrations](/integrations/chat/microsoft-teams/sending-an-internal-message).
- As a Microsoft Teams bot registered with Azure. This is suitable for bots published to the Microsoft Teams Store, and supports both [sending notifications to channels](/integrations/chat/microsoft-teams/sending-a-message-to-channels) and [sending direct messages to users](/integrations/chat/microsoft-teams/sending-a-direct-message).

How you configure your Microsoft Teams channel in Knock depends on the method you choose.

## How to connect to Teams with Knock

### Prerequisites

If you're using an incoming webhook URL, there are no prerequisites.

If you're using a Microsoft Teams bot, make sure your bot has been registered and deployed with Azure. Knock does not manage deploying and configuring your bot. To set up Knock to send notifications as your bot, you'll need your bot's ID and password. These are sometimes called the App ID and App Password, and were provided to you when you registered your bot with Azure or the <a href="https://dev.teams.microsoft.com/" target="_blank">Microsoft Teams Developer Portal</a>.

Additionally, if you intend to use [TeamsKit](/in-app-ui/react/teams-kit) or Knock's [Microsoft Teams-related React hooks](/in-app-ui/react/teams-kit#using-teamskit-headless), you'll need to [configure a Graph API-enabled application in the Microsoft Entra admin center](#configuring-a-graph-api-enabled-application-in-microsoft-entra).

  text={
    <>
      At this time, Knock only supports Microsoft Teams bots that have been
      registered with Azure as single-tenant or multi-tenant.
    </>
  }
/>

### Add Teams to Knock as a channel

First you'll need to add Teams as a channel in Knock. Navigate to **Channels and sources** in your Knock dashboard account settings and click ‚ÄúCreate channel‚Äù to add Microsoft Teams.

If you're using an incoming webhook URL, no additional environment configuration is required.

If you're using a Microsoft Teams bot, follow these steps to configure your bot in the Knock dashboard.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the environment configuration dialog">
    Click ‚ÄúManage configuration‚Äù and scroll down to ‚ÄúProvider settings‚Äù.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select your bot‚Äôs type">
    If your bot is registered with Azure as a single-tenant bot, select ‚ÄúSingle-tenant‚Äù.
    Then, in the ‚ÄúEntra tenant ID‚Äù text field, enter the ID of the Microsoft
    Entra tenant in which your bot is registered.
    <br />
    If your bot is registered with Azure as a multi-tenant bot, select ‚ÄúMulti-tenant‚Äù in the ‚ÄúBot type‚Äù dropdown.
    Entering an ‚ÄúEntra tenant ID‚Äù is not required for multi-tenant bots.
    <br />
    You can locate these values in the <a href="https://portal.azure.com/" target="_blank">Azure Portal</a> by
    navigating to your Azure Bot resource and selecting ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù > ‚ÄúConfiguration‚Äù in the sidebar to view your
    bot‚Äôs configuration details. The ‚ÄúBot Type‚Äù dropdown menu will indicate whether your bot is multi-tenant or
    single-tenant. The ‚ÄúApp Tenant ID‚Äù text field will display the ID of your Entra tenant.

    </figure>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter your bot‚Äôs credentials">
    In the ‚ÄúBot ID‚Äù and ‚ÄúBot password‚Äù fields, enter the ID and password
    associated with your bot. Click the ‚ÄúUpdate settings‚Äù button to save your
    changes.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter your Graph API-enabled client credentials">
    If you intend to use TeamsKit, you'll need to enter the client ID and secret associated with a [Graph API-enabled application](#configuring-a-graph-api-enabled-application-in-microsoft-entra) registered with Microsoft Entra. If your bot has been registered with Azure as a multi-tenant bot, you can use your bot's credentials.

    In the ‚ÄúGraph API client ID‚Äù and ‚ÄúGraph API client secret‚Äù fields, enter the client ID and secret associated with your application.

    Click the ‚ÄúUpdate settings‚Äù button to save your changes.

  </Step>
</Steps>

### Add a Teams channel step to a workflow

Next, navigate to a workflow in Knock that you want to notify Teams and add a chat channel step. Select the Teams channel you just configured and create a notification template for the channel.

You can learn more about how to write basic and advanced templates for Teams in the [designing notifications templates section](#designing-notification-templates-for-teams) of this guide.

### Trigger the workflow

Now you're ready to notify Teams. [Trigger the workflow](/send-notifications/triggering-workflows) that you added your Teams channel to. You'll need to include the user or object that has your Teams channel data as a `recipient` on the workflow trigger call.

<MultiLangCodeBlock
  snippet="workflows.trigger-with-object-as-recipient"
  title="Trigger a workflow with an object recipient"
/>

Your Teams channel should have received a notification. If you need to debug your integration, you can view the logs page in the Knock dashboard.

## Configuring a Graph API-enabled application in Microsoft Entra

To use TeamsKit, you'll need to configure the API permissions and OAuth redirect URL associated with a Graph API-enabled application in the Microsoft Entra admin center. If your bot has been registered with Azure as a multi-tenant bot, you can use your bot's app registration.

<Steps titleSize="h3">
  <Step title="Find your application in the Microsoft Entra admin center">
    Log in to the <a href="https://entra.microsoft.com/" target="_blank">Microsoft Entra admin center</a>. In the sidebar, navigate to **Entra ID** > **App registrations**, and locate your application.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure OAuth">
    On your app's registration page, click **Authentication**. Under **Platform configurations**, click **Add a platform** and select **Web**.

    Copy and paste the following URL into the **Redirect URI** text field:

    <CopyableText
      label="https://api.knock.app/providers/ms-teams/authenticate"
      content="https://api.knock.app/providers/ms-teams/authenticate"
    />

    This will allow Knock to handle the OAuth redirect on behalf of your application, and manage connecting a Microsoft Entra tenant to a Knock tenant.

    Under **Supported account types**, select **Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Microsoft Entra ID tenant - Multitenant)**.

    Click **Configure** to save your changes.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Add API permissions">
    In the top-level sidebar, navigate to **API permissions** and click **Add a permission**. Select **Microsoft Graph** > **Application permissions**.

    Under **Select permissions**, add the following permissions:

    - `Team.ReadBasic.All`: This permission allows your bot to read a list of all teams within a Microsoft Entra tenant.
    - `Channel.ReadBasic.All`: This permission allows your bot to read a list of all channels within a team.
    - `AppCatalog.Read.All`: This permission allows your bot to locate itself in the Microsoft Teams app catalog.
    - `TeamsAppInstallation.ReadWriteSelfForTeam.All`: This permission allows your bot to install itself into a team.
    - `TeamsAppInstallation.ReadWriteSelfForUser.All`: This permission allows your bot to install itself into a user's personal scope.

    Click **Add permissions** to save your changes.

  </Step>
</Steps>

## How to set channel data for a Microsoft Teams integration in Knock

In Knock, the [`ChannelData`](/managing-recipients/setting-channel-data) concept provides you a way of storing recipient-specific connection data for a given integration. If you reference the [channel data requirements for Microsoft Teams](/managing-recipients/setting-channel-data#chat-app-channels), you'll see that there are two different schemas for an `MsTeamsConnection` stored on a [`User`](/concepts/users) or an [`Object`](/concepts/objects) in Knock.

Here's an example of setting channel data on an `Object` in Knock.

<MultiLangCodeBlock
  snippet="objects.setChannelData.msTeams"
  title="Store Microsoft Teams connection on object"
/>

<br />

<Callout
  emoji="üö®"
  style={{ marginTop: "0" }}
  title="Potential confusion alert."
  text={
    <>
      In the example above, the <code>KNOCK_TEAMS_CHANNEL_ID</code> variable is
      the id of the Knock channel you've created to represent your Microsoft
      Teams integration within the Knock dashboard. You can find it by going to{" "}
      <span className="font-bold">Integrations</span> {">"}{" "}
      <span className="font-bold">Channels</span> in the Knock dashboard and
      then copying the ID of your Microsoft Teams channel.
    </>
  }
/>

### Recipient channel data requirements

Here's an overview of the data requirements for [setting recipient channel data](/send-notifications/setting-channel-data) for either an incoming webhook URL or a Microsoft Teams bot connection. Both will need to live under the `connections` key.

| Property    | Type                  | Description                                |
| ----------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| connections | `MsTeamsConnection[]` | One or more connections to Microsoft Teams |

An `MsTeamsConnection` can have one of two schemas, depending on whether you're using a Microsoft Teams bot or an incoming webhook.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="MsTeamsConnection as a bot" description="For self-serve customer integrations">
    If you're using a Microsoft Teams bot, your `MsTeamsConnection` schema looks like this. You'll use
    either `ms_teams_channel_id` or `ms_teams_user_id` depending on whether you're storing connection data to message a channel or user in Microsoft Teams:

    | Property            | Type     | Description                    |
    | ------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------ |
    | ms_teams_tenant_id  | `string` | A Microsoft Entra tenant ID    |
    | ms_teams_team_id    | `string` | A Microsoft Teams team ID      |
    | ms_teams_channel_id | `string` | A Microsoft Teams channel ID   |
    | ms_teams_user_id    | `string` | A Microsoft Teams user ID      |

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="MsTeamsConnection with an incoming webhook url" description="For internal or one-off integrations">
     If you're using an incoming webhook, your `MsTeamsConnection` schema is quite simple:

    | Property             | Type     | Description                                                                 |
    | -------------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | incoming_webhook.url | `string` | The Microsoft Teams incoming webhook URL (to be used instead of the properties above) |

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Tenant channel data requirements

When you [map a Microsoft Entra tenant to a Knock tenant](/integrations/chat/microsoft-teams/sending-a-message-to-channels#key-concepts), you'll store the ID of the Microsoft Entra tenant as `channel_data` on the Knock tenant. Then, when you apply the Knock `tenant` to your workflow triggers, Knock will [combine that Microsoft Entra tenant ID with the recipient's](/integrations/chat/microsoft-teams/sending-a-message-to-channels#merging-channel-data) `channel_data` to send notifications to the correct Microsoft Teams channel within a Microsoft Entra tenant. For this implementation method, the `ms_teams_tenant_id` on the recipient's `MsTeamsConnection[]` data above is not required.

Here's an overview of the data requirements for setting channel data when storing a Microsoft Entra tenant ID on a Knock tenant.

| Property           | Type     | Description                 |
| ------------------ | -------- | --------------------------- |
| ms_teams_tenant_id | `string` | A Microsoft Entra tenant ID |

```json title="Microsoft Teams channel_data on a tenant"
{
  "ms_teams_tenant_id": "MS_TEAMS_TENANT_ID"
}
```

### Setting channel data: users vs. objects

Depending on the Microsoft Teams integration you build into your product, you'll store the connection data you receive from Microsoft Teams as `channel_data` on either a `User` or an `Object` in Knock.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Users" description="For notifying users via direct message">
    If your integration involves a user opting in to receive direct messages from your Microsoft Teams integration, you‚Äôll be storing the channel data [on that user](/api-reference/users/set_channel_data) in Knock. When you want to notify this user, you'll include them as a recipient in a Knock workflow trigger.

    For this integration, you'll store a user's Microsoft Teams `ms_teams_user_id` in the `MsTeamsConnection` object.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Objects" description="For notifying Microsoft Teams channels about non-user resources">
    If your integration involves a customer connecting a _non-user resource_ in their product (such as a project or a page) to a Microsoft Teams channel, you‚Äôll want to store that channel data [on an object](/api-reference/objects/set_channel_data) in Knock, as it‚Äôs not specific to any single user.

    For this integration, you'll store a Microsoft Teams `ms_teams_channel_id` in the `MsTeamsConnection` object. The [`MsTeamsChannelCombobox`](/in-app-ui/react/teams-kit#msteamschannelcombobox) component of Knock's TeamsKit can help you with this.

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Designing notification templates for Teams

When you add a new Teams channel step to a workflow in Knock, you'll need to configure a template for that step so Knock knows how to format the message to Teams.

By default, we provide a basic markdown editor that you can use for sending simple messages to Teams. Just write in Markdown and we'll handle the rest. (Note: As of February 2022, Teams only supports the following markdown styles: bold, italic, unordered lists, ordered lists, hyperlinks. All other markdown styles are not supported.)

### Advanced Teams notifications

If you find yourself wanting to send notifications that include more advanced formatting and interactivity, such as buttons, data layouts, and so on, you'll need to use Microsoft's <a href="https://adaptivecards.microsoft.com/" target="_blank">Adaptive Card format</a> to build your notification templates in Knock. This is essentially a JSON block language you use to lay out your Microsoft Teams message.

To switch to the JSON editor in the Knock template designer, look for the "Switch to JSON editor" button at the bottom of the template editor page. When you're in JSON editing mode, you can provide adaptive card JSON and we'll pass it to Microsoft Teams on your behalf.

Here's an example of the JSON you'll need to provide. Note that you must include your Adaptive Card JSON within the `attachments` array and set the `contentType` to `application/vnd.microsoft.card.adaptive`.

```json title="Example JSON for sending an Adaptive Card to Microsoft Teams"
{
  "attachments": [
    {
      "content": {
        "type": "AdaptiveCard",
        "$schema": "https://adaptivecards.io/schemas/adaptive-card.json",
        "version": "1.5",
        "body": [
          {
            "type": "TextBlock",
            "text": "Lorem ipsum dolor sit"
          }
        ],
        "speak": "Lorem ipsum dolor sit"
      },
      "contentType": "application/vnd.microsoft.card.adaptive",
      "contentUrl": null
    }
  ],
  "type": "message"
}
```
