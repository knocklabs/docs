In this guide, we'll cover how to update a multi-tenant Microsoft Teams bot to send direct messages to Teams users using Knock. It assumes that you have already created a Microsoft Teams channel in Knock as outlined in the [Microsoft Teams integration overview](/integrations/chat/microsoft-teams/overview) guide.

Here's what we'll cover in this guide:

- Modeling a multi-tenant application in Knock using `Tenants`
- Adding required scopes to your Microsoft Teams app's manifest
- Setting required Tenant and User channel data when a Microsoft Teams bot is installed in a user's personal scope
- Triggering a workflow with a user recipient to send a message to a DM

## Prerequisites

Make sure your bot has been registered with <a href="https://dev.botframework.com/" target="_blank">Microsoft Bot Framework</a> and is deployed to Azure. Knock does not manage deploying and configuring your bot. To set up Knock to send notifications as your bot, see [How to connect to Teams with Knock](/integrations/chat/microsoft-teams/overview#how-to-connect-to-teams-with-knock).

## Key concepts

`Tenants` are a concept you'll see throughout the following docs that are foundational to how Knock's Microsoft Teams integration works, but might not be used in every implementation of Knock.

### About tenants

[Tenants](/concepts/tenants) in Knock are meant to represent groups of users who typically share the same resources. You might call these "accounts," "organizations," "workspaces," or something similar. In a typical Microsoft Teams implementation, you'll store <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/quickstart-create-new-tenant" target="_blank">the ID of a Microsoft Entra tenant</a> on a corresponding tenant in Knock.

If you already use Knock's tenant concept to power other 'account-based' features, you likely create tenants in Knock when an account or organization is created in your application.

      <strong>Note: </strong>
      Our best-practice recommendation is that tenants in Knock should map one-to-one
      to whatever abstraction you use to model accounts, organizations, or workspaces.
      You can think of tenants as the top-level container within your data model
      that you use to power multi-tenancy in your application.

### Merging channel data

In this implementation, we'll actually store [the required channel data](/integrations/chat/microsoft-teams/overview#channel-data-requirements) for an `MsTeamsConnection` across two different entities in Knock: a `Tenant` and an `User`. This is because we want to store the `ms_teams_tenant_id` for the Microsoft Entra tenant on the Knock `Tenant` and the `ms_teams_user_id` for the Microsoft Teams user on the Knock `User`.

When you trigger a workflow using this recipient and tenant, Knock will merge the channel data from the `Tenant` and the `User` to send the message to the correct Microsoft Teams user.

## Adding required scopes to your app's manifest

In order for your bot to send direct messages to users in Microsoft Teams, you'll need to update your <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/resources/schema/manifest-schema" target="_blank">Microsoft Teams app's manifest</a> so that it includes the `personal` scope for your bot.

In your `manifest.json` file, add `personal` to your bot's array of scopes:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/json-schemas/teams/v1.17/MicrosoftTeams.schema.json",
  "manifestVersion": "1.17",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "id": "{{YOUR_TEAMS_APP_ID}}",
  "bots": [
    {
      "botId": "{{YOUR_BOT_ID}}",
      "scopes": ["personal"]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Setting Tenant and User channel data

Your application should provide a method for admin users to set up your bot within a Microsoft Teams tenant. When this occurs, your backend should update the channel data associated with the Knock `Tenant`, passing in the tenant ID of the Microsoft Teams tenant.

If you're using Knock's Node SDK, your code might look like this:

```javascript
await knockClient.objects.setChannelData(
  "$tenants",
  "knocklabs",
  process.env.KNOCK_MS_TEAMS_CHANNEL_ID,
  { ms_teams_tenant_id: msTeamsTenantId },
);
```

Here, `KNOCK_MS_TEAMS_CHANNEL_ID` is the channel ID of your Microsoft Teams integration within Knock, and `"knocklabs"` is the ID of the current `Tenant` logged into the application.

Once your Microsoft Teams bot is installed in a user's personal scope, your bot's messaging endpoint will receive <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/bots/how-to/conversations/subscribe-to-conversation-events#installation-update-event" target="_blank">an installation update event</a>. You can use this event to update the channel data associated with the Knock `User`.

If you're using the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/botbuilder-js" target="_blank">Bot Framework SDK for JavaScript</a> with the Knock Node SDK, your code will look something like this:

```javascript
import { Knock } from "@knocklabs/node";
const knockClient = new Knock(process.env.KNOCK_API_KEY);

export class TeamsBot extends TeamsActivityHandler {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.onInstallationUpdateAdd(async (context, next) => {
      const { activity } = context;

      // Bot was installed into a user's personal scope
      if (activity.conversation.conversationType === "personal") {
        const msTeamsUserId = activity.from.id;

        knockClient.users
          .setChannelData(
            "user_1n38knd",
            process.env.KNOCK_MS_TEAMS_CHANNEL_ID,
            { connections: [{ ms_teams_user_id: msTeamsUserId }] },
          )
          .catch(console.error);
      }

      await next();
    });
  }
}
```

Here, `"user_1n38knd"` represents the ID of the Knock `User` associated with this Microsoft Teams user, and should be replaced with a Knock `User` ID that you retrieve from your database. How you get this ID depends upon your specific application.

## Triggering a workflow

Once you have saved the user's Microsoft Teams user ID as channel data, you can trigger a workflow to send a message to that user's DM channel. Here's an example of how to trigger a workflow using the Knock Node SDK:

```javascript
const workflow_run_id = await knockClient.workflows.trigger("new-issue", {
  recipients: ["user_1n38knd"],
  tenant: "knocklabs",
  data: {
    message: formData.get("newIssue"),
  },
});
```
