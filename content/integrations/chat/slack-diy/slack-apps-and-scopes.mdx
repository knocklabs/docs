If you're not using Knock's managed approach to integrating Slack with [SlackKit](/integrations/chat/slack-kit/overview), you can build the OAuth flow yourself. In this guide we'll walk through the basics of configuring the OAuth scopes your Slack app will need for different notification use cases.

### Simple use cases: incoming webhook scope

For simple messaging use cases you can use the `incoming-webhook` scope.

When a Slack app has the `incoming-webhook` scope, the user installing it decides which channel the app can send messages to via an `incoming_webhook.url` returned in the OAuth flow response. (If you are just using Slack to message an internal workspace, you can find these webhook URLs in the **Incoming Webhook** section of the app management page.)

During the OAuth flow for an `incoming-webhook` Slack app, your user can connect to any channel they have access to in their Slack workspace. This means public channels, private channels, or even the direct message channel for that individual user.

This makes the `incoming-webhook` scope a quick and simple way to set up use cases such as:

- A Slack integration that notifies a Slack channel whenever something happens in your product
- A Slack integration that notifies a #new-signups channel in your internal workspace when new users sign up in your product
- A Slack integration that notifies an individual of everything happening in your product

You can even let a given customer install your `incoming-webhook` app multiple times to map different objects in your product to different Slack channels in their workspace.

Take the Linear example below. Under “Team notification” I can see a record for each of my teams in Linear — when I toggle a Team on for Slack notifications, Linear starts a Slack OAuth flow that asks for a single scope: `incoming-webhook`. During that OAuth flow, I choose which Slack channel I want to receive notifications about that particular team.

We get into more detail how to support these use cases using Knock in [our Slack examples page](/integrations/chat/slack/slack-examples).

### Advanced use cases: access tokens and all other scopes

One limitation of the `incoming-webhook` scope is that you'll need your customers to OAuth to Slack every time they want to connect your product to a Slack channel in their Slack workspace. If you want your users to only have to OAuth into their Slack workspace once, you'll use Slack's [OAuth v2 method](https://api.slack.com/authentication/oauth-v2) to get an access token with specific scopes related to the use cases you want to power with your Slack bot.

Here are a few key scopes to know about when you’re thinking about notifications in Slack:

- `chat:write` Post messages in approved channels & conversations. At a minimum your app needs this scope to send notifications to a Slack workspace.
- `channels:read` View basic information about public channels in a workspace. This enables you to fetch a list of public channels in a workspace so you can surface them to your user when they're choosing which Slack channel to notify about events in your product. Learn more in Slack’s docs on [sending messages](https://api.slack.com/messaging/sending).
- `chat:write.public` Send messages to channels your Slack app isn't a member of. If your app doesn’t have this scope, you’ll need to use the [`conversations.joins`](https://api.slack.com/methods/conversations.join) method to join a public channel before sending it messages.
- `im:write` Start direct messages with users in Slack.
