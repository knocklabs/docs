Building a Slack integration can feel like a daunting task. There is a lot you can build on top of the Slack API and app platform, and there's a lot of documentation that comes with it. Knock has SlackKit to manage all of that for you, but you also have the option of building it yourself. We'll cover both methods of integrating Slack into your application in the guides that follow:

- **The Knock-Slack model.** An overview of how you'll build your Knock-Slack integration and the key concepts involved.
- **Building a Slack app.** How to build a Slack app you'll use for SlackKit or your own DIY approach.
- **SlackKit.** Knock's managed approach to integrating Slack (recommended).
- **DIY Integration.** How to build your own Slack integration with Knock.
- **Designing Slack templates.** How to design your Slack notification templates in Knock using our markdown or JSON block editors.
- **Powering Slack interactivity.** How to build interactive Slack messages using Knock.
- **Example use cases.** Step-by-step walkthroughs of a number of example Slack use cases, from notifying a user via DM to notifying a channel in your own Slack workspace.
