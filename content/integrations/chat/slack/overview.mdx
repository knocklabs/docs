In this guide you'll learn how to use Knock to send notifications to Slack. There are two ways to do this:

1. [SlackKit](/integrations/chat/slack-kit/overview): Follow this guide to use the Knock-managed approach to integrating Slack. Using this method, Knock handles authorization and API calls to Slack on your users' behalf and provides pre-built components and hooks for you to quickly build out the UI of your Slack integration.
2. [DIY Slack OAuth](/integrations/chat/slack-diy/slack-apps-and-scopes): If you want to connect Slack yourself either via incoming webhooks or access tokens, this guide will show you how to implement this for yourself. You'll have to build out the UI yourself when using this method.
