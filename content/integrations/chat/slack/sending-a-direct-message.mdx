## Sending direct messages to a user in your customerâ€™s Slack workspace

If you want to notify a user in Slack via direct message instead of through a channel, you can still accomplish this through a simple Slack app with the `incoming-webhook` scope. (This is possible because during the OAuth flow for an app with the `incoming-webhook` scope, the installing user can select their own Direct Message channel for the integration.)

![An example of selecting a Direct Message in an OAuth flow](/images/slack-oauth-flow-select-channel.png)

Just surface your Slack OAuth flow to users in their personal notification settings and [store the webhook URL](/integrations/chat/slack-diy/building-oauth-flow#setting-channel-data-users-vs-objects) received from the OAuth process on the relevant `user` in Knock.

You can learn more users and channel data in our docs on [how to set channel data](https://docs.knock.app/send-notifications/setting-channel-data).
