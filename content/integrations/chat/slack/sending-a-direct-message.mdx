In this guide we'll cover how to create a self-serve Slack integration for a multi-tenant application using Knock. It assumes that you have already created a Slack app and created a Slack channel in Knock as outlined in the [Slack integration overview](/integrations/chat/slack/overview) guide.

In this implementation, your application's users will connect their Slack workspace to Knock and be able to send messages to individual users via DM. To make this easier to implement, we'll use Knock's [SlackKit components](/in-app-ui/react/slack-kit) to facilitate the OAuth flow.

Here's what we'll cover in this guide:

- Modeling a multi-tenant application in Knock using `Tenants`
- Implementing a Slack OAuth flow using Knock's `SlackAuthButton` component
- Using the `access_token` stored in Knock to request a user's Slack ID
- Triggering a workflow with a user recipient to send a message to a DM

## Key concepts

SlackKit connects multiple concepts in Knock to make it easier for your application's users to create a Slack integration. `Tenants` are a concept you'll see throughout the following docs that are foundational to how SlackKit works, but might not be used in every implementation of Knock.

### About tenants

[Tenants](/concepts/tenants) in Knock are meant to represent groups of users who typically share the same resources. You might call these "accounts," "organizations," "workspaces," or something similar. In a standard SlackKit implementation, you'll store a Slack workspace's `access_token` on a corresponding tenant in Knock.

If you already use Knock's tenant concept to power other 'account-based' features, you likely create tenants in Knock when an account or organization is created in your application. If you don't already use tenants in Knock, SlackKit can create tenants for you on the fly if they don't already exist.

      Our best-practice recommendation is that tenants in Knock should map
      one-to-one to whatever abstraction you use to model accounts,
      organizations, or workspaces. You can think of tenants as the top-level
      container within your data model that you use to power multi-tenancy in
      your application.
    </>

### Merging channel data

In this implementation, we'll actually store [the required channel data](/integrations/chat/slack/overview#channel-data-requirements) for a `SlackConnection` across two different entities in Knock: a `Tenant` and an `User`. This is because we want to store the `access_token` for the Slack workspace on the `Tenant` and the `user_id` for the Slack user on the `User`.

When you trigger a workflow using this recipient and tenant, Knock will merge the channel data from the `Tenant` and the `User` to send the message to the correct Slack DM channel. By storing the `access_token` on the `Tenant`, your customers only need to complete the OAuth flow once to connect their Slack workspace to Knock. From there, you can create UI that allows users to link their Slack user ID to their Knock user ID or automate this process during user registration.

## Implementing SlackKit

To facilitate the OAuth flow and channel selection process, we'll use Knock's [SlackKit components](/in-app-ui/react/slack-kit). SlackKit is a set of React components that make it easier to build Slack integrations in Knock. You can use SlackKit to build a self-serve Slack integration that allows your users to connect their Slack workspace to Knock.

### Signing a user token

The only access you'll need to manage when using SlackKit are grants for your users to interact with their [Tenant](/concepts/tenants) in Knock. This is necessary because the user in this context is an end user in your application who does not have access to Knock as a [member of the account](/manage-your-account/managing-members). Therefore, these grants provide them elevated privileges to operate on specific resources using the API.

We've made it easy for you to tell Knock which resources your users should have access to by making it a part of their user token. In this section you'll learn how to generate these grants using the Node SDK and, if you're not using the SDK, how to structure them for other languages.

You'll need to generate a token for your user that includes access to the tenant storing the Slack access token as well as any recipient objects storing Slack channel data described in this reference on [SlackKit resource access grants](/in-app-ui/react/slack-kit#resources-access-grants).

Using the below example, you can quickly generate a token with the [Node SDK](https://github.com/knocklabs/knock-node#signing-jwts).

```javascript
import {
  signUserToken,
  buildUserTokenGrant,
  Grants,
} from "@knocklabs/node/lib/tokenSigner";

const token = await signUserToken("user-1", {
  grants: [
    buildUserTokenGrant({ type: "tenant", id: "org_3sh72ds78" }, [
      Grants.SlackChannelsRead,
    ]),
  ],
});
```

You'll need to pass this token along with the public API key to the `KnockProvider` that wraps `KnockSlackProvider` and the rest of your components. We recommend storing the generated user token in local storage so that your client application has easy access to it.

### Adding provider components

In order to give your components the data they need, they must be wrapped in the `KnockSlackProvider`. We recommend putting this high in your component tree so that any Slack components that you use will be rendered within it. The Slack provider goes inside of the `KnockProvider`. Your hierarchy will look like this:

```javascript title="Wrap your UI components in data providers"
<KnockProvider
    apiKey="Public API key"
    userId="User ID"
    userToken="Generated user token with resource grants"
>
    <KnockSlackProvider
        knockSlackChannelId="Knock Slack channel ID"
        tenant="Tenant ID"
    >
        {child components}
    </KnockSlackProvider>
</KnockProvider>
```

The `KnockSlackProvider` gives your components access to the status of the connection to your Slack app, so that they can all be in sync when a user is connecting, disconnecting, or experiencing a connection error.

### Implementing the OAuth flow with `SlackAuthButton`

Your users will give your Slack app access to their own Slack workspaces via the `SlackAuthButton`. This button can be used on its own, or nested in the `SlackAuthContainer` for a bigger visual footprint.

    width={1310}
    height={564}
  />
  <figcaption>The SlackAuthButton component with SlackAuthContainer</figcaption>
</figure>

Since we'll also be using this `access_token` to resolve a user's email address to their Slack ID, we'll need to add some additional scopes to this OAuth request. We can do that by adding the `users:read` and `users:read.email` scopes to the `SlackAuthButton` component with the `additionalScopes` parameters.

Here's an example of how to use them:

```javascript title="Initiate OAuth and display auth state with SlackAuthButton"
// Without container
<SlackAuthButton
    slackClientId="Slack app client ID"
    redirectUrl="The URL of your application to return to once Slack authorization is complete"
    additionalScopes={["users:read", "users:read.email"]}
/>

// With container
<SlackAuthContainer
    actionButton={
        <SlackAuthButton
            slackClientId="Slack app client ID"
            redirectUrl="The URL of your application to return to once Slack authorization is complete"
            additionalScopes={["users:read", "users:read.email"]}
        />
    }
/>
```

The `SlackAuthButton` maps a tenant in your product to a customer's Slack workspace. This means in most cases you'll just need a single instance of the `SlackAuthButton`.

Remember to consider which roles in your application can access the `SlackAuthButton` component. Knock does not control access to the component. In most cases, you'll add this connect button and container in the settings area of your product.

### Resolving a user's Slack ID

To send a direct message to a user in Slack, you'll need to resolve their email address to their Slack ID. You can do this one of two ways: automatically using Knock's email-based user ID resolution, or manually by making a request to the Slack API with the `access_token` stored in Knock.

#### Enabling email-based user ID resolution

Knock's email-based user ID resolution handles the complexity of resolving a user's Slack ID for you. Here's how it works.

When the email-based user ID resolution setting is enabled and a workflow is triggered for a user recipient, Knock will automatically make a request to the <a href="https://api.slack.com/methods/users.lookupByEmail" target="_blank">`users.lookupByEmail` endpoint of the Slack API</a> to resolve the user's Slack ID before sending the message. When this Slack API request succeeds, Knock will automatically add the Slack user ID to the user's channel data so that the API request does not need to be repeated in the future. Note that this API request will only be made when the user has a [valid email attribute](/concepts/users#optional-attributes).

To use this feature, you must request the <a href="https://api.slack.com/scopes/users:read" target="_blank">`users:read`</a> and <a href="https://api.slack.com/scopes/users:read.email" target="_blank">`users:read.email`</a> scopes during the OAuth flow. See [How to connect Slack to Knock](/integrations/chat/slack/overview#how-to-connect-slack-to-knock) for more information about Slack scopes. If you're using SlackKit's `SlackAuthButton` component to manage the OAuth flow, you can use the `additionalScopes` prop to request these scopes.

```javascript title="Requesting the users:read and users:read.email scopes with SlackAuthButton"
// Without container
<SlackAuthButton
  slackClientId="Slack app client ID"
  redirectUrl="The URL of your application to return to once Slack authorization is complete"
  additionalScopes={["users:read", "users:read.email"]}
/>
```

<br />

  title="Important:"
  text={
    <>
      If you enable the email-based user ID resolution setting but you haven't
      already been requesting the <code>users:read</code> and{" "}
      <code>users:read.email</code> scopes, any of your application's tenants
      who have already connected their Slack workspace to Knock will need to
      complete the OAuth flow again to re-authorize your app.{" "}
      <strong>Otherwise, the Slack API request will fail.</strong>
    </>
  }
/>

Once you're confident that all of your application's tenants have granted authorization with the required scopes, you can enable this setting on either a Slack channel or a step in a workflow.

#### Manually resolving a user's Slack ID

If you wish to manually resolve a user's Slack ID from their email address, you can do so from your application's backend by making a request to the Slack API with the `access_token` stored in Knock. Here's an example of how you might create a `fetchUserId` function to do this using the Knock Node SDK:

```javascript
export async function fetchUserId(email: string): Promise<string> {
  // First, get the access token from Knock for the user's tenant
  const channelData = await knock.objects.getChannelData(
      "$tenants",
      'knocklabs',
      process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_KNOCK_SLACK_CHANNEL_ID as string,
    );
  // Next, use that access to to make a request to the Slack API
  const response = await fetch(
    `https://slack.com/api/users.lookupByEmail?email=${email}`,
    {
      headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer ${channelData.data.token.access_token}`,
      },
    },
  );
  const data = await response.json();
  if (data.ok) {
    // If the request is successful, save the user's Slack ID as channel data on the user
    await knock.users.setChannelData(
      userId,
      process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_KNOCK_SLACK_CHANNEL_ID as string,
      {
        connections: [{ user_id: slackUserId }],
      },
    );
  }
  return data;
}
```

We'll break this function down step-by-step:

<Steps titleSize="h4">
  <Step title="Get the `access_token` stored in Knock for the user's tenant">
    Since your users have already connected their Slack workspace to Knock, you can use the `knockClient.objects.getChannelData` method to get the `access_token` for the user's tenant. Tenants in Knock are stored in a system-reserved object collection called `$tenants`.

    ```javascript
    await knock.objects.getChannelData(
        "$tenants",
        'knocklabs',
        process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_KNOCK_SLACK_CHANNEL_ID as string,
    );
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Make a request to the Slack API">
    Once you have the tenant's `access_token`, you can use it to make a request to the Slack API to resolve the user's email address to their Slack ID using the `users.lookupByEmail` endpoint.

    ```javascript
    const response = await fetch(
      `https://slack.com/api/users.lookupByEmail?email=${email}`,
      {
        headers: {
          Authorization: `Bearer ${channelData.data.token.access_token}`,
        },
      },
    );
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Save the user's Slack ID as channel data on the user">
    Assuming the request to the Slack API is successful, you can save the user's Slack ID as channel data on the user in Knock. This will allow you to send messages to the user's Slack DM channel.

    ```javascript
    await knock.users.setChannelData(
        userId,
        process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_KNOCK_SLACK_CHANNEL_ID as string,
        {
            connections: [{ user_id: slackUserId }],
        },
    );
    ```

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Triggering a workflow

Once you have saved the user's Slack ID as channel data, you can trigger a workflow to send a message to that user's DM channel. Here's an example of how to trigger a workflow using the Knock Node SDK:

```javascript
const workflow_run_id = await knockClient.workflows.trigger("new-issue", {
  recipients: ["user_1n38knd"],
  tenant: "knocklabs",
  data: {
    message: formData.get("newIssue"),
  },
});
```

## Frequently asked questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How can I fix `The user token supplied is invalid` error when connecting to Slack?">
    This error typically indicates a `400`-status response because the authenticated user does not have permissions to write to Slack-specific resources in Knock like a tenant or object. Check that you are providing a valid user token to the `KnockProvider` component that carries grants for writing to a specific tenant or object.

    You can learn more about generating user tokens with the proper grants in the [Signing a user token](#signing-a-user-token) section above.
