Once you've set up your Knock account with the Slack app and generated user tokens granting access to Knock resources, you're ready to use SlackKit's pre-built components or build your own on top of the hooks and API endpoints that come with SlackKit.

- [SlackKit component documentation](/in-app-ui/react/slack-kit#using-slackkit-components)
- [SlackKit headless documentation](/in-app-ui/react/slack-kit#using-slackkit-headless)

Now that you've enabled your users to authorize their Slack application and select channels to notify, you can trigger a workflow to their Slack channels.
