SlackKit is Knock's collection of components, hooks, and API's to quickly set up Slack in your application for your users to integrate with their own workspaces.

      SlackKit is currently in beta. If you have questions or feedback,{" "}
      <a href="mailto:support@knock.app?subject=SlackKit">please reach out</a>.
    </>
  }
/>

Instead of handling the OAuth handshake, access token grants, and channel connection yourself, you can use our pre-built components or build your own components on top of our API.

We also have two **example apps** for you to get the feel of how to integrate Slack and Knock with SlackKit:

- [SlackKit tutorial](https://github.com/knocklabs/javascript/tree/main/examples/slack-kit-example)
- [SlackKit components example](https://github.com/knocklabs/javascript/tree/main/examples/slack-connect-example)

In this section, you'll learn how to:

1. [Set up your SlackBot](/integrations/chat/slack-kit/setup)
2. [Grant your users access to the Knock data they need with signed JWT tokens](/integrations/chat/slack-kit/resource-access-grants)
3. [Add SlackKit UI](/integrations/chat/slack-kit/ui)
4. [Trigger notifications using tenants](/integrations/chat/slack-kit/trigger-workflow)
