SlackKit is Knock's collection of components, hooks, and APIs to quickly set up Slack in your application for your users to integrate with their own workspaces.

      SlackKit is currently in beta. If you have questions or feedback,{" "}

Instead of handling the OAuth handshake, access token grants, and channel connection yourself, you can use our pre-built components or build your own components on top of our API.

## Key concepts

SlackKit connects multiple concepts in Knock to make it easier for users to create a Slack integration. There are two key concepts you'll see throughout the following docs that are foundational to how SlackKit works, but might not be used in every implementation of Knock: tenants and objects.

### About tenants

[Tenants](/concepts/tenants) in Knock are meant to represent segments of your user base. You might call these "accounts," "organizations," "workspaces," or something similar. In a standard SlackKit implementation, you'll store a Slack workspace's `access_token` on a corresponding tenant in Knock.

If you already use Knock's tenant concept to power other 'account-based' features, you likely create tenants in Knock when an account or organization is created in your application. If you don't already use tenants in Knock, SlackKit can create tenants for you on the fly if they don't already exist.

      <strong>Note: </strong>
      Our recommendation on best practice is that tenants in Knock should map one-to-one
      to whatever abstraction you use to model accounts, organizations, or workspaces.
      You can think of tenants as the top-level container within your data model
      that you use to power multi-tenancy in your application.
    </>
  }
/>

### About objects

[Objects](/concepts/objects) in Knock are flexible abstractions meant to map to a resource in your system. Each individual object in Knock exists within a `collection` and requires an `id` unique to that collection.

In the context of SlackKit, objects serve two purposes. First, they store the Slack channel or channels you want to notify. Second, they act as the recipient of the workflow that sends message to Slack.

<Callout

  text={

      <strong>Note: </strong>
      You can think of collections as the different tables within your database that
      represent resources in your application. Objects are the rows within those
      tables.

#### Example

Let's say we're building an example source control application like GitHub, where teams can collaborate and share code repositories. In this context, each GitHub organization would map to a tenant in Knock, and each repository would become an object inside of a `repositories` collection.

If we want to be notified in Slack each time an issue is opened against a repository, we would store a Slack channel on each repository object and then trigger a `new-issue` workflow. Knock will use the data stored on the object and tenant to route a message to the correct Slack channel:

```javascript
await knockClient.workflows.trigger("new-issue", {
  recipients: [
    {
      collection: "repositories",
      id: "knocklabs/javascript",
    },
  ],
  tenant: "knocklabs",
  data: {
    message: formData.get("newIssue"),
  },
});
```

## Next steps

We also have two **example apps** for you to get the feel of how to integrate Slack and Knock with SlackKit:

- [SlackKit tutorial](https://github.com/knocklabs/javascript/tree/main/examples/slack-kit-example)
- [SlackKit components example](https://github.com/knocklabs/javascript/tree/main/examples/slack-connect-example)

In this section, you'll learn how to:

1. [Set up your SlackBot](/integrations/chat/slack-kit/setup)
2. [Grant your users access to the Knock data they need with signed JWT tokens](/integrations/chat/slack-kit/resource-access-grants)
3. [Add SlackKit UI](/integrations/chat/slack-kit/ui)
4. [Trigger notifications using tenants](/integrations/chat/slack-kit/trigger-workflow)
