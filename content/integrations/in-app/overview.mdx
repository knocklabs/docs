In addition to delivering to out-of-app channels such as email, push, SMS, and chat apps like Slack, you can also use Knock to build great in-app notifications experiences too.

You can use our in-app feed channel to build stateful, in-app notifications experiences like floating feeds, inboxes, toasts and banners, and you can use our preferences API to build powerful user-facing preference controls. You can also use [Knock link tracking](/send-notifications/tracking) to capture link-click events right within your Knock account.

For a complete guide on powering in-app notifications with Knock, see our [building in-app UI docs](/in-app-ui/overview).
