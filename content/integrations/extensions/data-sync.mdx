You can bring your notification analytics from Knock into your own data warehouse so that you can analyze it alongside the rest of your data. To set up this sync, please contact our [support team](mailto:support@knock.app).

## How it works

Knock integrates with your data warehouse using [Prequel](https://www.prequel.co/). There is no self-service UI to connect your account – please [contact our support team to get started](mailto:support@knock.app). We will need some information about your data warehouse, including its destination type. Depending on the type (supported databases listed [here](https://docs.prequel.co/docs/destinations-overview)), we may ask for additional details.

Once the necessary data warehouse information is provided, Knock will provide you with a unique magic link. This link will guide you through a step-by-step wizard tailored to your specific data warehouse destination. Upon successful connection, a [backfill of historical data](https://docs.prequel.co/docs/transfer-logic#backfills--full-refreshes) will begin and you will continue to receive the most up-to-date data every 24 hours.

## Available data

### Messages table

Our data warehouse connector syncs data from our `messages` table. Each `message` represents a notification that was executed for a single recipient. You can read more about messages as a concept [here](/concepts/messages).

Below is a description of the columns included in the table and the data type of each. To see how this data type will map onto the data types of your destination table, check the [destination type mapping](https://docs.prequel.co/docs/data-types#destination-type-mapping) in the Prequel docs.

### Recipient change stream table

<Callout

  title="Note:"
  text={
    <>
      at this time, the recipient change stream table contains only users.
      Please <a href="mailto:support@knock.app">contact us</a> if you need to
      sync other recipient types.
    </>
  }
/>

Our data warehouse connector syncs data from our `recipients` table. Each row captures the properties and preferences of a [Recipient](/concepts/recipients) at a given moment in time.

Each row has an `event_type` indicating how the event was generated. Possible values are:

- `recipient.created` - indicates the first time a recipient was identified
- `recipient.snapshot` - is emitted every time a recipient's properties or preferences are updated, and contains the complete set of properties and preferences at that moment in time. This event may also be generated manually for all or a subset of recipients (by ID) by contacting support.
- `recipient.deleted` - contains no properties or preferences, but indicates when a recipient was deleted. A recipient may be re-identified after being deleted, which will generate another recipient.created event

Events in the recipient change stream table are retained for 7 days.

Below is a description of the columns included in the table and the data type of each. To see how this data type will map onto the data types of your destination table, check the [destination type mapping](https://docs.prequel.co/docs/data-types#destination-type-mapping) in the Prequel docs.
