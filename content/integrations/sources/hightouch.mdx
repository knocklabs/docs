## Getting started

Knock integrates with [Hightouch](https://hightouch.com) as a downstream destination to sync customer and event data from your data warehouse.

## Use cases

You can use our Hightouch integration to:

1. Sync customer data into Knock from your data warehouse (identify)
2. Trigger workflows from records added, changed, or removed in your data warehouse
3. Populate [Audiences](/concepts/audiences) with data from your data warehouse. Audiences can be used to trigger workflows or power conditional logic during workflow execution.

## Syncing customer data into Knock from Hightouch

You can use the [HTTP request destination](https://hightouch.com/docs/destinations/http-request) within Hightouch to sync your customer data from your data warehouse into Knock.

For this example, we're going to make a call to the [Knock API users identify endpoint](/api-reference/users/update).

      <strong>Note:</strong> you can also extend this technique to make other
      calls to the Knock API from your Hightouch models to sync object data or
      trigger workflows. Please{" "}
      <a href="mailto:support@knock.app?subject=Hightouch help">get in touch</a>{" "}
      if you'd like any additional help.
    </>
  }
/>

1. Create a new HTTP request destination and select your model to query from
2. Set an `Authorization` header, with the value set to `Bearer <your Knock secret API key>`. You can find your secret API key in [your dashboard](https://dashboard.knock.app) under **Developers** > **API keys**
3. Name your destination "Knock API"
4. Create a new sync with your Knock API destination
5. Select the types of events that should trigger, the most common case here is "Rows added"
6. Set the HTTP request method to `PUT` and the URL to `https://api.knock.app/v1/users/{{ row.user_id }}` where `{{ row.user_id }}` corresponds to the user identifier in the table
7. Select a "JSON" payload and "Use the JSON editor" to craft the request
8. Add at least a `name`, `email`, or `phone_number` field from your users table
9. For the rate limit, you can specify 60 requests per second
10. You'll likely want to "backfill" all of the available rows meaning that any existing data will also be synced to Knock
11. Click "Continue"
12. Select your sync frequency
13. Click "Finish"

An example configuration for your sync may look something like this:

```json title="Example sync configuration"
{
  "add": {
    "enabled": true,
    "method": "PUT",
    "url": "https://api.knock.app/v1/users/{{ row.user_id }}",
    "timeout": 30,
    "contentType": "application/json",
    "hasRateLimit": true,
    "bodyType": "template",
    "body": "{\n \"name\": \"{{ row.first_name }} {{ row.last_name }}\",\n \"email\": \"{{ row.email_address }}\",\n \"phone_number\": \"{{ row.phone_number }}\"\n}",
    "rateLimit": 60,
    "rateLimitTime": "second",
    "onError": "retryRequest",
    "retries": 3
  },
  "change": {},
  "remove": {},
  "skipFirstRun": false
}
```
