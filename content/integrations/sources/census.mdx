Knock integrates with [Census](https://getcensus.com) as a downstream destination to sync customer and event data from your data warehouse.

## Use cases

You can use our Census integration to:

1. Sync customer data into Knock from your data warehouse (identify)
2. Trigger workflows from records added, changed, or removed in your data warehouse
3. Populate [Audiences](/concepts/audiences) with data from your data warehouse. Audiences can be used to trigger workflows or power conditional logic during workflow execution.
