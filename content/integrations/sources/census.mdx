## Getting started

Knock can be integrated as a downstream destination in <a href="https://getcensus.com" target="_blank">Census</a> to sync customer and event data from your data warehouse.

### Use cases

You can use our Census integration to:

1. Sync customer data into Knock from your data warehouse ([identify recipients](/managing-recipients/identifying-recipients)).
2. [Trigger workflows](/send-notifications/triggering-workflows/overview) from records added, changed, or removed in your data warehouse.
3. Populate [audiences](/concepts/audiences) with data from your data warehouse. Audiences can be used to trigger workflows or power conditional logic during workflow execution.

## Configure Knock as a destination in Census

Before you can sync data into Knock from Census, you need to configure Knock as a destination.

### Prerequisites

1. Determine which Knock environment you want to sync your data to. You most likely want to sync in the Production environment, unless you’re configuring a test sync.
2. Have your Knock environment’s secret API key ready. Each environment has its own unique set of API keys; you can find your secret API key in your dashboard under **Platform** > **API keys**. Be sure that the correct environment is selected in the switcher at the top of the page.
3. Choose your destination type. Your options are:

- **Custom destination** - Our recommended destination type for syncing audiences into Knock from Census. Setup is simpler and includes automatic support for removing a user from an audience during your syncs without additional configuration.
- **HTTP Request destination** - This destination type is required if you need to [sync users and their properties to Knock](#syncing-customer-data-into-knock-from-census) or if you need to include [tenant](/concepts/tenants) data in your Knock audience.

      </Step>
      <Step title="Configure the destination">
        **a.** Input a destination name. We recommend something like **Knock Production** that correlates to the Knock environment that you're syncing to.
        
        **b.** Copy and paste the following into the API URL field: 
        ```txt title="Knock Custom Destination API URL"
        https://api.knock.app/v1/integrations/census/custom-destination
        ```
        <br/>
        **c.** Click the "+ Add Header" button to add an `Authorization` <a href="/api-reference/overview/authentication">header</a>. Be sure to toggle the "Secret" setting for the value:

        | Header | Value |

        <br/>

        **d.** Leave “1” selected as the API Version, then click "Connect" to complete the configuration. 
        
        Census will now test connectivity with Knock. This process may take a few moments to complete.
