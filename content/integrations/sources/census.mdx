## Getting started

Knock can be integrated as a downstream destination in <a href="https://getcensus.com" target="_blank">Census</a> to sync customer and event data from your data warehouse.

## Use cases

You can use our Census integration to:

1. Sync customer data into Knock from your data warehouse (identify)
2. Trigger workflows from records added, changed, or removed in your data warehouse
3. Populate [Audiences](/concepts/audiences) with data from your data warehouse. Audiences can be used to trigger workflows or power conditional logic during workflow execution.

## Syncing customer data into Knock from Census

## Syncing audiences into Knock from Census

Census Sources and Datasets can be synced to Knock audiences by configuring Knock as a Custom Destination or using an HTTP Request destination connected to Knock’s public Audiences API.

### Prerequisites

1. Determine which Knock environment you want to sync your audience to. You most likely want to sync in the Production environment, unless you’re configuring a test sync.
2. Create an audience in Knock that will serve as the target for your sync.
3. Have your Knock environment’s secret API key ready. Each environment has its own unique set of API keys; you can find your secret API key in your dashboard under **Platform** > **API keys**. Be sure that the correct environment is selected in the switcher at the top of the page.
4. Select a destination type. We recommend using our Custom Destination unless you need to sync [tenant](/concepts/tenants) data. If you need to sync tenant data to your audience, you must use an HTTP Request destination.

### Configure Knock as a Census destination

Before you can sync audiences into Knock from Census, you need to configure Knock as a destination in Census.
