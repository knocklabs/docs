## Recipient data requirements

In order to send an email notification you'll need a valid `email` property set on your recipient.

## Delivery tracking

Delivery tracking for MailerSend can result in the following status updates to your message:

- The message delivery is confirmed and Knock updates the message to `delivered`
- The message was not delivered due to bad recipient(s) and Knock updates the message to `bounced`
