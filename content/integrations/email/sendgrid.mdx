Knock integrates with [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com) to send email notifications to your users.

In this guide you'll learn how to get started sending transactional email notifications with SendGrid through Knock. We also cover provider configuration and additional data you can pass through to SendGrid.

## Features

- Attachments support
- Delivery tracking (only supported for SendGrid accounts with Email Activity)
- Bounce support (only supported for SendGrid accounts with Email Activity)
- Link and open tracking
- Per environment configuration
- Sandbox mode

## Getting started

### Connect SendGrid to Knock

You can create a new SendGrid channel in the dashboard under the **Integrations** {">"} **Channels** section. From there, you'll need to configure the channel for each environment you have.

Here are a few things to note as you configure your SendGrid provider:

- **API key.** At a minimum, Knock needs an API key with full access to the **Mail Send** permission. If you’re looking to support delivery tracking, you’ll need to provide Knock with a SendGrid API key that includes read access to the **Email Activity** permission. (Note: email activity requires [a SendGrid paid add-on](https://sendgrid.com/solutions/add-ons/30-days-additional-email-activity-history/).)
- **Check delivery status.** If enabled, you can go to the email activity page in SendGrid to check the delivery status of a given email.
- **Enable email open tracking.** If enabled, you can go to the email activity page in SendGrid to check the open status of a given email.
- **Enable email link tracking.** If enabled, you can go to the email activity page in SendGrid to check the link open status of a given email.

If you choose to enable open and link tracking, please keep user privacy top of mind and follow the privacy guidelines outlined in [SendGrid’s documentation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/account-and-settings/tracking).

And that’s it. You’ll see the normal email provider configurations for "from email address" and "from name," as well as any environment defaults you want to send for email recipient fields.

</Attributes>

## Additional data sent

Knock sends the following attributes along with your emails:

- `custom_args.sender`: always set to `knock.app`
- `custom_args.knock_message_id`: the ID of the message this email is associated with
- `custom_args.knock_recipient_id`: the Knock ID of the recipient this email is being sent to
- `tags[0]`: the key of the workflow this message was generated from

You can learn about the role of these SendGrid attributes in the [SendGrid API documentation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/).

## Recipient data requirements

In order to send an email notification you'll need a valid `email` property set on your recipient.

## Delivery tracking

Delivery tracking for SendGrid can result in the following status updates to your message:

- The message delivery is confirmed and Knock updates the message to `delivered`
- The message was not delivered and Knock updates the message to `undelivered`
- The message was not delivered due to a bad recipient and Knock updates the message to `bounced`
