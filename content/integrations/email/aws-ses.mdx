Knock integrates with <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ses/" target="_blank">AWS Simple Email Service (SES)</a> to send email notifications to your users.

In this guide you'll learn how to get started sending transactional email notifications with SES through Knock. We also cover provider configuration and additional data you can pass through to SES.

## Features

- Attachments support
- Knock link and open tracking
- Per environment configuration
- Sandbox mode

## Getting started

You can create a new AWS SES channel in the dashboard under **Channels and sources** in your account settings. From there, you'll need to take some steps in AWS before you can configure your SES channel within Knock.

<Steps titleSize="h3">
  <Step title='Verify a "From" address within AWS SES'>
    You'll need to verify the **"From" email address** you plan on using to send emails with AWS if you haven't already. To do so, follow the steps outlined in AWS's guide to <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/creating-identities.html#verify-email-addresses-procedure" target="_blank">creating and verifying an email address identity</a>.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose an AWS Authentication Scheme">
    Knock supports two authentication schemes with AWS SES:
  
    <AccordionGroup>
      <Accordion title="Option 1: Create an AWS IAM User with security credentials">
        To send notifications via AWS SES using an IAM User, Knock requires the **access key ID** and a **secret access key** of an AWS user with SES send permissions. (Specifically, the `ses:SendEmail` and `ses:SendRawEmail` permissions.)

        If you don't already have a user with send permissions, you can create an IAM user in AWS to use with the Knock API. You can learn more about creating IAM users in AWS <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html" target="_blank">here</a>.

        Once you've created your new IAM user, you'll need to provision them with the policy below.

        ```json title="IAM user policy"
        {
          "Version": "2012-10-17",
          "Statement": [
            {
              "Effect": "Allow",
              "Action": ["ses:SendEmail", "ses:SendRawEmail"],
              "Resource": "*"
            }
          ]
        }
        ```

        Now that you have an AWS user created and provisioned with SES send access, grab the **access key ID** and a **secret access key** of the user—we'll use these later when configuring the SES channel within Knock.
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="Option 2: Create an AWS IAM Role with a trust policy for Knock">
        To send notifications via AWS SES by <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_common-scenarios_third-party.html" target="_blank">delegating an IAM Role</a> in your AWS account to Knock, <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-user_externalid.html" target="_blank">secured with an External ID</a>:

        1. Create a new AWS Role:

          - For "Trusted Entity Type" choose "AWS Account."
          - Select "Another AWS account" and put "496685847699" in the Account ID.
          - Check "Require external ID" and enter the ID of the SES channel you created in your Knock dashboard.

            className="rounded-md mx-auto border border-gray-200"
            alt="How Knock works diagram"
          />

        2. Attach the following permission policy to that role.

          ```json title="IAM user policy"
          {
            "Version": "2012-10-17",
            "Statement": [
              {
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Action": ["ses:SendEmail", "ses:SendRawEmail"],
                "Resource": "*"
              }
            ]
          }
          ```

        3. Use that role's ARN when configuring your AWS SES channel in Knock.

        4. Enable Security Token Service (STS) for the `us-east-2` region in your AWS account. This enables Knock to generate temporary security credentials for sending email via SES. For more information, review the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_enable-regions.html#sts-regions-activate-deactivate" target="_blank">AWS documentation on enabling STS for another region</a>.
      </Accordion>
    </AccordionGroup>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Configuring SES in Knock">
    Now that you have a verified "From" address and either an AWS User's credentials or an AWS IAM Role to delegate to Knock, you're ready to [configure your SES channel](#channel-configuration) in the Knock dashboard under the **Channels and sources** tab in your account settings.

  </Step>
</Steps>

Here are a few other things to keep in mind once you have your SES channel configured in Knock:

- **SES sandbox mode.** By default, AWS places all new accounts in the SES sandbox. While your account is in the sandbox, you can only send emails to verified email address—keep this in mind if you're testing in development before you've moved your account out of the SES sandbox. For more information on the SES sandbox and how to move your account out of it, see the [SES sandbox documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/request-production-access.html).
- **Deliverability tracking.** We cannot currently track deliverability through SES channels. This means that all notifications sent through SES will show up as "Sent" in the Knock messages log, but not "Delivered."

## Channel configuration

The following channel settings should be configured per [environment](/concepts/environments). Navigate to **Channels and sources** in your dashboard account settings, select your AWS SES [channel](/concepts/channels), then click "Manage configuration" under the environment that you'd like to configure.

## Additional data sent

Knock sends the following attributes along with your emails (all as `Tags`):

- `Sender`: always set to `knock.app`
- `knock_message_id`: the ID of the message this email is associated with
- `knock_workflow`: the key of the workflow this message was generated from
- `knock_recipient_id`: the Knock ID of the recipient this email is being sent to

You can learn about the role of these SES attributes in the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/Welcome.html" target="_blank">AWS Simple Email Service (SES) API documentation</a>.

    <>
      Keep in mind that AWS SES tags can be up to 256 characters long of only
      ASCII letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), underscores (_), or dashes (-).
      If your <span className="font-bold">knock_recipient_id</span> does not
      meet these requirements, Knock will truncate{" "}
      <span className="font-bold">knock_recipient_id</span> to 256 characters
      and remove any prohibited characters.

## Recipient data requirements

In order to send an email notification you'll need a valid `email` property set on your recipient.
