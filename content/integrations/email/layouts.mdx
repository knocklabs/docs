When you use Knock to power your email notifications, you use two main concepts to build the notifications that will be sent to your users: layouts and templates.

The **layout** typically includes the header and footer of your email, as well as any other HTML or CSS that will be used across all (or multiple) templates. You can think of your email layout as the "frame" of your email notifications, where you define the shared structure and styles once for all your email notifications so they can look and feel consistently without having to repeat them in every template.

The **template** is the actual body and content of your email. When you add an email step to a workflow, the content that you edit within the template editor is the template that will be wrapped by the layout mentioned above. Under the hood, Knock is injecting this template into the `{{content}}` variable of the email layout.

Here's an example of a transactional email we send at Knock, complete with the template content merged into the layout. The area shaded in green is the template. The area shaded in blue is the layout.

Here's a quick overview of the system-level variables Knock provides for use in your layouts.

| Variable       | Description                                                                                                                                                                   |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `content`      | A notification template defined in an email channel step will be inserted into this variable. **This is a required variable, and must be present somewhere in every layout.** |
| `footer_links` | A list of footer links, as configured in the layout editor, will be injected into this variable. This is an optional variable and is not required in custom layouts.          |

## The Knock default layout

Your Knock account starts with a pre-built default layout. If you navigate to **Content** > **Email layouts** in the sidebar of your Knock dashboard, you'll find this default layout. This default layout will be used by all new email templates when they're initially created, so if you want to change the default layout used by your emails, this is the one to update.

Click on the "Default" layout in your layouts list to enter the layout editor. You'll start by looking at the pre-built layout that Knock gives you out of the box. You'll find a footer design option in this visual builder where you can add footer links to this pre-built layout for HTML emails. You can update the logo, icon, and brand color of your email layout by going to the **Branding** page under the **Account** section of your account settings and updating these attributes.

If you'd rather create your own layout from scratch, you can click "Edit in code editor" in the top right corner of the layout editor to enter our [custom layout](/integrations/email/layouts#custom-layouts-and-styling) editor.

Every layout includes the text layout for plaintext emails, and the concept works the same as the HTML layout where the text content of your email template will be injected into the `{{content}}` variable. Click the "Text" tab to switch to the text layout, and edit it as you see fit.

## Selecting a layout for a given email template

All new email templates created within workflows will use your `default` email layout. If you would like to use a different layout for a specific step, open the template editor, click the gear icon (‚öôÔ∏è) to access the template settings, and select your preferred layout from the "Email layout" dropdown in the modal. After saving, you can use the preview pane on the right side of the editor to see how your template will render with the selected layout.

If you'd like to create an email step in your workflow that contains the full HTML document at the template level (without a layout wrapper), you can select "No layout" in this dropdown.

      Email layouts follow the Knock environment commit model, so you'll need to
      commit them to your current environment before you'll see them appear in
      your email notifications.
    </>
  }
/>

## Custom layouts and styling

If you want to create your own custom email layouts, you can go into the layout editor and click "Edit in code editor" to go to an HTML and CSS editor for your email layout. The important thing to remember here is that your layout needs a `{{content}}` somewhere in its `body` tag for the email template to be injected into the layout.

<Callout
  emoji="üå†"
  title="Note:"
  text={
    <>
      if you're providing a custom HTML layout for your emails, the layout must
      be a valid HTML document.
    </>
  }
/>

### Creating new layouts

To create a new layout, go to **Developers** > **Layouts** and click "Create layout." All new layouts start in Knock's visual layout editor, but you can override this default by clicking "Edit in code editor."

### Using custom fonts

Knock supports custom web fonts that are referenced inside your email layout's `<head>`. This should be done via a `<link>` tag, as the style `@import` rule is not supported:

```html
<link
  href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@400;500;700&display=swap"
  rel="stylesheet"
/>
```

Because many widely-used email clients do not support web fonts, we highly recommend choosing a web safe font as a fallback when using custom web fonts to ensure a consistent user experience.

### Using variables and brand attributes in a custom layout

It's helpful to remember that you can use variables you create at the account and environment-levels by injecting them into your layout with the `vars.*` namespace. This is a great tool for global values that will be the same across all emails you send, such as base URL for embedded links in your email notifications.

You can also use the `vars.branding.*` namespace for injecting the branding properties you set in account settings. The following branding properties are available for use in custom layouts.

- `vars.branding.logo_url`
- `vars.branding.icon_url`
- `vars.branding.primary_color`
- `vars.branding.primary_color_contrast`

If you use [per-tenant branding](/concepts/tenants#custom-branding), remember that Knock automatically evaluates these properties and shows the relevant branding elements based on the `tenant_id` associated with a given workflow run. As an example: if I trigger a workflow that includes a tenant_id with custom branding elements set on their `tenant`, the layout will use those branding elements. If no custom branding elements are set on the `tenant`, then the account default branding elements will be used.

### Injecting workflow run scope into a layout at runtime

If you have a workflow-run-scoped variable that you'd like to inject into your layouts, you can do so with normal liquid variable injection, so long as the variables come after the place in your layout where `{{content}}` is first rendered. (If you need to inject variables into your layout above your `{{content}}` variable, see the ["Defining pre-content variables" section](/integrations/email/layouts#defining-pre-content-variables) below.)

As an example, let's say my email template is using the [Liquid capture tag](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/tags/variable/) to create a variable called `formatted_price` within the email template. If I want to inject that `formatted_price` value into the footer of my layout, I can do so by using the `{{formatted_price}}` variable in the footer of my layout file.

### Defining pre-content variables

When the Knock notification engine sends an email notification, it compiles your email template with its selected layout to create a **single email template** that is sent to your recipient.

In this process, the templates that you define in your email channel steps are injected into the `{{ content }}` tag in your email layout.

In cases where you want to inject a template-level variable above the `{{ content }}` tag of your email layout, you can set **pre-content variables** to inject variables into your layout above where your `{{ content }}` tag will render.

To set pre-content variables for your template, open the email template editor, click the three-dot menu in the top right corner and select "Manage template overrides." You'll add your pre-content variables to the pre-content field using liquid syntax.

You can use pre-content variables to:

- Declare any template-specific liquid variables to control or dynamically alter parts of your email layout without needing to create separate email layouts.
- Declare any template-specific liquid variables for use _throughout_ your email template in a single, clear location.

<Callout
  emoji="üå†"
  title="Note:"
  text={
    <>
      by default, anything you put in the pre-content field will be injected
      into both the text and HTML versions of your template. As such you should
      be careful to only use this space to declare variables and not actual
      content.
    </>
  }
/>

### Including preview text

Knock allows you to set custom preview text for any email template which is displayed by most email clients. To enable this, your email layout must include the `{{ preview_text }}` slot before any other content. Once your layout includes this slot, you can set the preview text for any email template in the template editor.

Here's an example of how to add the preview text slot to your email layout:

```html title="An email layout with a preview text slot"
<html>
  <body>
    <div style="display: none; max-height: 0px; overflow: hidden;">
      {{ preview_text }}
    </div>
    <!-- the rest of email layout -->
    {{ content }}
  </body>
</html>
```

### Defining a blank email layout

If you're looking to create an email template in your workflow that doesn't use a layout to wrap the content of your email, you should select "No layout" in the "Email layout" dropdown within your email channel step's template settings.

## Layouts and the visual template editor

Regardless of the layout you've chosen for a given email step, you'll be able to use the [visual template editor](/send-notifications/designing-workflows/template-editor#visual-editing-with-drag-and-drop-components) to compose the `content` of your email template.

<Callout
  emoji="üå†"
  title="Note:"
  text={
    <>
      Since each Knock email layout contains{" "}
      <code style={{ fontWeight: 600, backgroundColor: "inherit" }}>
        &lt;head&gt;
      </code>{" "}
      and{" "}
      <code style={{ fontWeight: 600, backgroundColor: "inherit" }}>
        &lt;body&gt;
      </code>{" "}
      tags, these tags should not be included in your workflow's email template.
      If you are transferring email content from an outside source, you may need
      to make adjustments to remove any{" "}
      <code style={{ fontWeight: 600, backgroundColor: "inherit" }}>
        &lt;head&gt;
      </code>{" "}
      and{" "}
      <code style={{ fontWeight: 600, backgroundColor: "inherit" }}>
        &lt;body&gt;
      </code>{" "}
      tags prior to saving your email template within a Knock workflow.
      Alternatively, you can select "No layout" on your email template.
    </>
  }
/>

When you use the visual template editor to insert components such as buttons and dividers into your email, Knock auto-generates CSS using a set of base component styles. You can find these styles in the section below, where we also cover updating these styles to match your design system.

<Callout
  type="alert"
  title="Reminder:"
  text={
    <>
      The visual template editor will only render component styles when you are
      in preview mode. This means that if you update base component styling,
      you'll only see those updates in preview mode.
    </>
  }
/>

### Updating base component styles

The components used in the visual template editor use the base component styles included below by default. These styles are auto-generated by Knock and injected into the top of `<head>` of your email layout at runtime.

If you want to override and modify these base component styles to match your design system, you can do so by adding them to the `<head>` of your layout file.

Keep in mind that to override any of the base component style properties listed below you'll need to include an `!important` tag to tell Knock to override the existing base styles that we'll inject into your template at runtime. As an example, if I wanted to update the font size of the `block-button-sm` component, I'd need to update its `font-size` property to `font-size: 20px !important;`.

```css title="Base component styles"
/* Button components */
.block-row.block-row--button_set-v1 .block-button {
  display: inline-block;
  box-sizing: border-box;
  text-decoration: none;
  -webkit-text-size-adjust: none;
}
.block-row.block-row--button_set-v1 .block-button.block-button--outline {
  border-style: solid;
}
.block-row.block-row--button_set-v1 .block-button.block-button--sm {
  font-size: 14px;
  line-height: 20px;
  min-width: 32px;
  padding-top: 4px;
  padding-bottom: 4px;
  padding-left: 8px;
  padding-right: 8px;
}

/* Divider component */
.block-row.block-row--divider-v1 .block-divider {
  border-bottom: 1px solid #dddee1;
}

/* Markdown components */
.block-row.block-row--markdown-v1 .block-markdown > :first-child {
  margin-top: 0;
}
.block-row.block-row--markdown-v1 .block-markdown > :last-child {
  margin-bottom: 0;
}
```

## Automate layout management with the Knock CLI

In addition to working with layouts in the Knock dashboard, you can programmatically create and update layouts using the [Knock CLI](/developer-tools/knock-cli) or our [Management API](/developer-tools/management-api).

If you manage your own email layout files within your application, you can automate the creation and management of Knock layouts so that they always reflect the state of the layout files you keep in your application code.

The Knock CLI can also be used to commit changes and promote them to production, which means you can automate Knock email layout management as [part of your CI/CD workflow](/developer-tools/integrating-into-cicd).

See the [Layout file structure](/cli/email-layout/file-structure) section in the CLI reference for details on how layout files are organized when working with the CLI.

You can learn more about automating layout management in the [Knock CLI reference](/cli/overview). Feel free to <a href="mailto:support@knock.app">contact us</a> if you have questions.
