In this guide we cover how to use email layouts and templates in Knock to send great looking notifications to your users.

## An intro to email layouts and templates in Knock

When you use Knock to power your email notifications, you use two main concepts to build the notifications that will be sent to your users: layouts and templates.

The **layout** typically includes the header and footer of your email, as well as any other HTML or CSS that will be used across all (or multiple) templates. You can think of your email layout as the "frame" of your email notifications, where you define the shared structure and styles once for all your email notifications so they can look and feel consistently without having to repeat them in every template.

The **template** is the actual body and content of your email. When you add an email step to a workflow, the content that you edit within the template editor is the template that will be wrapped by the layout mentioned above. Under the hood, Knock is injecting this template into the `{{content}}` variable of the email layout.

Here's an example of a transactional email we send at Knock, complete with the template content merged into the layout. The area shaded in green is the template. The area shaded in blue is the layout.

Here's a quick overview of the system-level variables Knock provides for use in your layouts.

| Variable       | Description                                                                                                                                                                   |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `content`      | A notification template defined in an email channel step will be inserted into this variable. **This is a required variable, and must be present somewhere in every layout.** |
| `footer_links` | A list of footer links, as configured in the layout editor, will be injected into this variable. This is an optional variable and is not required in custom layouts.          |

## The Knock default layout

Your Knock account starts with a pre-built default layout. If you navigate into the layouts page of the sidebar, you'll find this default layout. This default layout will be used by all new email templates when they're initially created, so if you want to change the default layout used by your emails, this is the layout to update.

Click on the "Default" layout in your layouts list to enter the layout editor. You'll start by looking at the pre-built layout that Knock gives you out of the box. You'll find a footer design option in this visual builder where you can add footer links to this pre-built layout for HTML emails. You can update the logo, icon, and brand color of your email layout by going to "Settings > Branding" and updating these attributes.

If you'd rather create your own layout from scratch, you can click "Edit in code editor" in the top right corner of the layout editor to enter our custom layout editor. You can learn more about custom layouts in the [custom layouts and styling section](/integrations/email/layouts#custom-layouts-and-styling) of this guide.

Every layout includes the text layout for plaintext emails, and the concept works the same as the HTML layout where the text content of your email template will be injected into the `{{content}}` variable. Click the "Text" tab to switch to the text layout, and edit it as you see fit.

## Working with multiple layouts

You can create multiple layouts in Knock for cases when you want different email notifications to have different styling. As an example, you may want to use one layout for the transactional notifications you send and another layout for any onboarding emails you send users when they first sign up for your product.

### Creating new layouts

To create a new layout, go to the layouts page and click "Create layout". All new layouts start in Knock's visual layout editor but you can override this default by clicking "Edit in code editor".

### Selecting a layout for a given email template

When you have multiple email layouts in Knock, all new email templates created within workflows will use your `default` email layout by default. To change the layout used by a given step, go to the template editor, click the "..." menu in the top right corner, and select "Manage template overrides". You'll see a layout select dropdown in the modal that opens. Once you've selected your layout, you can navigate to the preview tab of the template editor to see how your template looks within the context of your selected layout.

      <span className="font-bold">Note:</span> Email layouts follow the Knock
      environment commit model, so you'll need to commit them to your current
      environment before you'll see them appear in your email notifications.
    </>
  }
/>

## Custom layouts and styling

If you want to create your own custom email layouts, you can go into the layout editor and click "Edit in code editor" to go to an HTML and CSS editor for your email layout. The important thing to remember here is that your layout needs a `{{content}}` somewhere in its `body` tag for the email template to be injected into the layout.

<Callout
  emoji="ðŸŒ "
  text={
    <>
      <span className="font-bold">Note:</span> if you're providing a custom HTML
      layout for your emails, the layout must be a valid HTML document.
    </>
  }
/>

### Using variables and brand attributes in a custom layout

It's helpful to remember that you can use variables you create at the account and environment-levels by injecting them into your layout with the `vars.*` namespace. This is a great tool for global values that will be the same across all emails you send, such as base URL for embedded links in your email notifications.

You can also use the `vars.branding.*` namespace for injecting the branding properties you set in account settings. The following branding properties are available for use in custom layouts.

- `vars.branding.logo_url`
- `vars.branding.icon_url`
- `vars.branding.primary_color`
- `vars.branding.primary_color_contrast`

If you use [per-tenant branding](/send-and-manage-data/tenants#custom-branding-advanced-feature), remember that Knock automatically evaluates these properties and shows the relevant branding elements based on the `tenant_id` associated with a given workflow run. As an example: if I trigger a workflow that includes a tenant_id with custom branding elements set on their `tenant`, the layout will use those branding elements. If no custom branding elements are set on the `tenant`, then the account default branding elements will be used.

### Injecting workflow run scope into a layout at runtime

If you have a workflow-run-scoped variable that you'd like to inject into your layouts, you can do so with normal liquid variable injection, so long as the variables come after the place in your layout where `{{content}}` is first rendered. (If you need to inject variables into your layout above your `{{content}}` variable, see the ["Defining pre-content variables" section](/integrations/email/layouts#defining-pre-content-variables) below.)

As an example, let's say my email template is using the [Liquid capture tag](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/tags/variable/) to create a variable called `formatted_price` within the email template. If I want to inject that `formatted_price` value into the footer of my layout, I can do so by using the `{{formatted_price}}` variable in the footer of my layout file.

### Defining pre-content variables

When the Knock notification engine sends an email notification, it compiles your email template with its selected layout to create a **single email template** that is sent to your recipient.

In this process, the templates that you define in your email channel steps are injected into the `{{ content }}` tag in your email layout.

In cases where you want to inject a template-level variable above the `{{ content }}` tag of your email layout, you can set **pre-content variables** to inject variables into your layout above where your `{{ content }}` tag will render.

To set pre-content variables for your template, open the email template editor, click the three-dot menu in the top right corner and select "Manage template overrides". You'll add your pre-content variables to the pre-content field using liquid syntax.

You can use pre-content variables to:

- Declare any template-specific liquid variables to control or dynamically alter parts of your email layout without needing to create separate email layouts.
- Declare any template-specific liquid variables for use _throughout_ your email template in a single, clear location.

<Callout

  text={
    <>
      <span className="font-bold">Note:</span> by default, anything you put in
      the pre-content field will be injected into both the text and HTML
      versions of your template. As such you should be careful to only use this
      space to declare variables and not actual content.
    </>
  }
/>

As an example, let's say you need to inject a custom `previewText` variable at the top of your email layout, before your `{{ content }}` is rendered. You want your `previewText` to be rendered ahead of the `{{ content }}` block so that email clients correctly show the preview text associated with your message.

To do this your email layout would look like this:

```html An email layout with a preview text variable
<html>
  <body>
    <div style="display: none; max-height: 0px; overflow: hidden;">
      {{ previewText }}
    </div>
    <!-- the rest of email layout -->
    {{ content }}
  </body>
</html>
```

And then within the pre-content override of your email template you'd insert your `previewText` variable:

```markdown Pre-content field value
{% assign previewText = "Hello and welcome to Knock" %}
```

At notification runtime, your layout and pre-content would be rendered into the following email notification.

```html An email notification with pre-content and template at runtime
<html>
  <body>
    <span>Hello and welcome to Knock</span>
    <!-- my template code -->
  </body>
</html>
```

### Defining a blank email layout

If you're looking to use a blank or empty email layout you should use the following layout code.

```html A minimal blank HTML layout
<html>
  <body>
    {{ content }}
  </body>
</html>
```

## Layouts and the visual template editor

Regardless of the layout you've chosen for a given email step, you'll be able to use the [visual template editor](/send-notifications/designing-workflows/template-editor#visual-editing-with-drag-and-drop-components) to compose the `content` of your email template.

<Callout
  emoji="ðŸŒ "
  text={
    <>
      <span className="font-bold">Note: </span>Since each Knock email layout
      contains{" "}
      <code style={{ fontWeight: 600, backgroundColor: "inherit" }}>
        &lt;head&gt;
      </code>{" "}
      and{" "}
      <code style={{ fontWeight: 600, backgroundColor: "inherit" }}>
        &lt;body&gt;
      </code>{" "}
      tags, these tags should not be included in your workflow's email template.
      If you are transferringÂ email content from an outside source, you may need
      to make adjustments to remove any{" "}
      <code style={{ fontWeight: 600, backgroundColor: "inherit" }}>
        &lt;head&gt;
      </code>{" "}
      and{" "}
      <code style={{ fontWeight: 600, backgroundColor: "inherit" }}>
        &lt;body&gt;
      </code>{" "}
      tags prior to saving your email template within a Knock workflow.
    </>
  }
/>

When you use the visual template editor to insert components such as buttons and dividers into your email, Knock auto-generates CSS using a set of base component styles. You can find these styles in the section below, where we also cover updating these styles to match your design system.

<Callout
  emoji="ðŸš¨"
  text={
    <>
      <span className="font-bold">Reminder: </span>The visual template editor
      will only render component styles when you are in preview mode. This means
      that if you update base component styling, you'll only see those updates
      in preview mode.
    </>
  }
/>

### Updating base component styles

The components used in the visual template editor use the base component styles included below by default. These styles are auto-generated by Knock and injected into the top of `<head>` of your email layout at runtime.

If you want to override and modify these base component styles to match your design system, you can do so by adding them to the `<head>` of your layout file.

Keep in mind that to override any of the base component style properties listed below you'll need to include an `!important` tag to tell Knock to override the existing base styles that we'll inject into your template at runtime. As an example, if I wanted to update the font size of the `block-button-sm` component, I'd need to update its `font-size` property to `font-size: 20px !important;`.

```css Base component styles
/* Button components */
.block-row.block-row--button_set-v1 .block-button {
  display: inline-block;
  box-sizing: border-box;
  text-decoration: none;
  -webkit-text-size-adjust: none;
}
.block-row.block-row--button_set-v1 .block-button.block-button--outline {
  border-style: solid;
}
.block-row.block-row--button_set-v1 .block-button.block-button--sm {
  font-size: 14px;
  line-height: 20px;
  min-width: 32px;
  padding-top: 4px;
  padding-bottom: 4px;
  padding-left: 8px;
  padding-right: 8px;
}

/* Divider component */
.block-row.block-row--divider-v1 .block-divider {
  border-bottom: 1px solid #dddee1;
}

/* Markdown components */
.block-row.block-row--markdown-v1 .block-markdown > :first-child {
  margin-top: 0;
}
.block-row.block-row--markdown-v1 .block-markdown > :last-child {
  margin-bottom: 0;
}
```
