Knock supports sending email notifications to your users via the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP). In this configuration, Knock will act as an SMTP client and send email notifications to a specified SMTP server.

In this guide, we'll cover how to get started sending email notifications using SMTP with Knock.

## Features

- Attachments support
- Knock link and open tracking
- Per environment configuration
- Sandbox mode

## Getting started

You can create a new SMTP Relay channel in the dashboard under the **Channels and sources** tab in your account settings. From there, you'll need to configure the channel for each environment you have.

The following information is required to configure an SMTP Relay channel:

- SMTP server host
- SMTP server port
- Username
- Password

Please note the following:

- **Knock only supports authenticated SMTP connections.**
- **The port must support TLS.** Email providers commonly use port 587 for TLS, but check your provider's documentation to confirm.
- **We cannot currently track deliverability through SMTP Relay channels.** This means that all notifications sent via SMTP will show up as "Sent" in the Knock messages log, but not "Delivered."
- **Some SMTP relay servers (including Gmail) have rate limits on authentication.** This means that they aren't well-suited to sending transactional email at scale. We recommend taking this into consideration when setting up an SMTP email channel in Knock.

## Channel configuration

The following channel settings should be configured per [environment](/concepts/environments). Navigate to **Channels and sources** in your dashboard account settings, select your SMTP [channel](/concepts/channels), then click "Manage configuration" under the environment that you'd like to configure.

## Setting SMTP headers

For SMTP Relay channels, the JSON overrides field can be used to set SMTP headers. Overrides can be set in either the environment settings or per template.

Knock supports overriding existing SMTP headers and adding custom headers.

```json title="Adding a custom SMTP header via JSON overrides"
{
  "headers": {
    "X-SMTPAPI": "{\"category\": \"transactional\"}"
  }
}
```

Headers must be nested under the `headers` key. Other keys will be ignored.

<Callout
  emoji="ðŸ”¦"
  title="SMTP headers are sent as strings."
  text={
    <>
      If one of your header overrides is not already a string, Knock will
      automatically convert it to a string before sending.
    </>
  }
/>

## Recipient data requirements

In order to send an email notification you'll need a valid `email` property set on your recipient.
