## Recipient data requirements

To send an email notification you'll need a valid `email` property set on your recipient.

## Delivery tracking

Delivery tracking can result in the following status updates to your message:

- The message delivery is confirmed and Knock updates the message to `delivered`
- The message was not delivered due to a bounce and Knock updates the message to `bounced`

## Frequently asked questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is the limit on the number of emails I can send?">
    You can send up to 100 emails per month for free.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What happens when I exceed the limit?">
    If you exceed the monthly limit, your emails will be marked as `undelivered`
    and will not be sent to the recipient. You will be able to send emails again
    at the start of the next month.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I use the Knock test channel?">
    You can use the Knock test channel to send email notifications to your
    users. To do this, you'll need to create a new workflow or broadcast and add
    a step that uses the Knock test channel.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I use this provider for production use?">
    No, this provider is for testing purposes only and is not intended for
    production use. For production use, please configure a different provider.

    Once you've setup a production email channel, you can change the channel on each of your existing email steps in your workflows to use the new provider. You'll need to commit and promote those changes in order for them to take effect.
