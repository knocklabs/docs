## Getting started

You can create a new Mailtrap channel in the dashboard under the {"Integrations > Channels"} section. From there, you'll need to configure the channel for each environment you have.

## Additional data sent

Knock sends the following attributes along with your emails:

- `custom_variables.knock_message_id`: the message ID attached to this email

## Recipient data requirements

To send an email notification you'll need a valid `email` property set on your recipient.
