Knock integrates with [Mailtrap](https://mailtrap.io/) to send email notifications to your users.

In this guide, you'll learn how to get started sending transactional email notifications with Mailtrap through Knock. We also cover provider configuration and additional data you can pass through to Mailtrap.

## Features

- Attachments support
- Delivery tracking
- Link and open tracking
- Per environment configuration
- Sandbox mode

## Getting started

You can create a new Mailtrap channel in the dashboard under the **Integrations** {">"} **Channels** section. From there, you'll need to configure the channel for each environment you have.

## Provider configuration

    name="API key"
    type="string*"

  />
  <Attribute
    name="From name"
    type="string | liquid"
    description="The sender name (can use Liquid tags)"
  />
</Attributes>

## Environment default settings

The following fields are optional and if set, will be applied to all email messages sent via this channel within the environment:

<Attributes>
  <Attribute
    name="Reply-to address"
    type="string | liquid"

  />
  <Attribute
    name="CC address"
    type="string | liquid"

  />
  <Attribute
    name="JSON overrides"
    type="string | liquid"

  />
</Attributes>

## Additional data sent

Knock sends the following attributes along with your emails:

- `custom_variables.knock_message_id`: the ID of the message this email is associated with
- `custom_variables.knock_recipient_id`: the Knock ID of the recipient this email is being sent to

## Recipient data requirements

To send an email notification you'll need a valid `email` property set on your recipient.
