## Getting started

You can create a new Mailgun channel in the dashboard under the **Integrations** {">"} **Channels** section. From there, you'll need to configure the channel for each environment you have.

## Additional data sent

Knock sends the following attributes along with your emails:

- `v:sender`: always set to `knock.app`
- `v:knock_message_id`: set to the message ID for the message being sent
- `o:tag`: the workflow key for the workflow being invoked

You can learn about the role of these Mailgun attributes in the [Mailgun API documentation](https://documentation.mailgun.com/en/latest/quickstart.html).

## Recipient data requirements

In order to send an email notification you'll need a valid `email` property set on your recipient.

## Delivery tracking

Delivery tracking for Mailgun can result in the following status updates to your message:

- The message delivery is confirmed and Knock updates the message to `delivered`
- The message was not delivered and Knock updates the message to `undelivered`
- The message was not delivered due to bad recipient(s) and Knock updates the message to `bounced`
