## Getting started

You can create a new Mailgun channel in the dashboard under the **Channels and sources** page in your account settings. From there, you'll need to configure the channel for each environment you have.

## Channel configuration

The following channel settings should be configured per [environment](/concepts/environments). Navigate to **Channels and sources** in your dashboard account settings, select your Mailgun [channel](/concepts/channels), then click "Manage configuration" under the environment that you'd like to configure.

## Additional data sent

Knock sends the following attributes to Mailgun along with your emails:

- `v:sender`: always set to `knock.app`
- `v:knock_message_id`: the ID of the message this email is associated with
- `v:knock_recipient_id`: the Knock ID of the recipient this email is being sent to
- `o:tag`: the workflow key for the workflow being invoked

You can learn about the role of these Mailgun attributes in the <a href="https://documentation.mailgun.com/en/latest/quickstart.html" target="_blank">Mailgun API documentation</a>.

## Recipient data requirements

In order to send an email notification you'll need a valid `email` property set on your recipient.

## Delivery status webhooks

When enabled, Mailgun will send delivery status updates directly to Knock via webhooks, allowing you to track the full lifecycle of your email messages in real-time.

### Prerequisites

Before enabling delivery status webhooks, you need:

1. A verified domain in Mailgun
2. A Mailgun channel configured in Knock (see the [getting started](#getting-started) section above)
3. Access to your Mailgun domain webhook settings

### Setting up delivery status webhooks

<Steps titleSize="h3">
  <Step title="Enable delivery status webhooks in Knock">
    1. Navigate to **Channels and sources** in your Knock dashboard
    2. Select your Mailgun channel
    3. Click "Manage configuration" for the environment you want to configure
    4. Scroll to the "Incoming message status updates" section and enable incoming webhooks
    5. Copy the generated webhook URL - you'll need this in the next step
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure webhooks in Mailgun">
    In the Mailgun dashboard, configure webhooks to send delivery events to Knock:

    1. Go to **Sending > Webhooks** in your Mailgun dashboard
    2. Select the domain you're using with Knock
    3. Add the webhook URL from Knock to these webhook types:
       - **Delivered messages** - Click "Add webhook URL", paste the Knock webhook URL, and save
       - **Permanent failure** - Click "Add webhook URL", paste the Knock webhook URL, and save
    4. Mailgun will automatically begin sending events to Knock

  </Step>
</Steps>

### Supported delivery statuses

When delivery status webhooks are enabled for Mailgun, Knock will update message statuses based on these Mailgun webhook events:

| Mailgun Event Type | Knock Status | Description                                                         |
| ------------------ | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| delivered          | `delivered`  | The email was successfully delivered to the recipient's mail server |
| failed             | `bounced`    | The email failed permanently due to invalid recipient or domain     |

### Troubleshooting

If delivery status updates aren't appearing in Knock:

1. **Check webhook configuration.** Verify both "Delivered messages" and "Permanent failure" webhooks are configured with the correct Knock webhook URL for your domain.
2. **Verify domain.** Ensure you're sending from a verified domain in Mailgun that matches the domain configured in your webhooks.
3. **Check webhook region.** Ensure your Mailgun region (US or EU) matches the region configured in your Knock channel settings.
4. **Test webhooks.** Send a test email and check the Webhooks page in Mailgun to verify events are being sent.
5. **Review webhook logs.** Check the webhook logs in Mailgun to see if requests are being sent successfully.

## Passing additional tags to Mailgun

It's possible to pass additional tags to Mailgun by setting the "JSON overrides" attribute in the channel configuration or at the message template level.

To pass one or more tags, you can set the `o:tag` attribute to an array of tag names:

```json
{
  "o:tag": ["tag1", "{{ workflow.key }}"]
}
```
