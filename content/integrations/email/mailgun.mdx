You can create a new Mailgun channel in the dashboard under the **Channels and sources** page in your account settings. From there, you'll need to configure the channel for each environment you have.

## Channel configuration

Navigate to **Channels and sources** in your dashboard account settings, select your Mailgun [channel](/concepts/channels), then click "Manage configuration" under the environment that you'd like to configure.

## Additional data sent

Knock sends the following attributes to Mailgun along with your emails:

- `v:sender`: always set to `knock.app`
- `v:knock_message_id`: the ID of the message this email is associated with
- `v:knock_recipient_id`: the Knock ID of the recipient this email is being sent to
- `o:tag`: the workflow key for the workflow being invoked

You can learn about the role of these Mailgun attributes in the <a href="https://documentation.mailgun.com/en/latest/quickstart.html" target="_blank">Mailgun API documentation</a>.

## Recipient data requirements

In order to send an email notification you'll need a valid `email` property set on your recipient.

## Delivery tracking

Delivery tracking for Mailgun can result in the following status updates to your message:

- The message delivery is confirmed and Knock updates the message to `delivered`
- The message was not delivered and Knock updates the message to `undelivered`
- The message was not delivered due to bad recipient(s) and Knock updates the message to `bounced`

## Passing additional tags to Mailgun

It's possible to pass additional tags to Mailgun by setting the "JSON overrides" attribute in the channel configuration or at the message template level.

To pass one or more tags, you can set the `o:tag` attribute to an array of tag names:

```json
{
  "o:tag": ["tag1", "{{ workflow.key }}"]
}
```
