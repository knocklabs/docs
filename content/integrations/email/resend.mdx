Knock integrates with <a href="https://resend.com/" target="_blank">Resend</a> to send email notifications to your users. Note: you will need an existing Resend account to set up this integration.

In this guide you'll learn how to get started sending transactional email notifications with Resend through Knock. We also cover provider configuration details.

## Features

- Attachments support
- Delivery tracking
- Bounce support
- Knock link and open tracking
- Per environment configuration
- Sandbox mode

## Getting started

You can create a new Resend channel in the dashboard under the **Channels and sources** tab in your account settings. From there, you'll need to configure the channel for each environment you have.

## Channel configuration

The following channel settings should be configured per [environment](/concepts/environments). Navigate to **Channels and sources** in your dashboard account settings, select your Resend [channel](/concepts/channels), then click "Manage configuration" under the environment that you'd like to configure.

## Recipient data requirements

To send an email notification you'll need a valid `email` property set on your recipient.

## Debugging common errors

### `Identity not found`

If you see an `Identity not found` error in your delivery logs this is because you need to verify your sending domain with Resend (the `From email address`).

## Delivery tracking

Delivery tracking for Resend can result in the following status updates to your message:

- The message delivery is confirmed and Knock updates the message to `delivered`
- The message was not delivered due to a bounce and Knock updates the message to `bounced`
