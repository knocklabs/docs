Knock integrates with <a href="https://resend.com/" target="_blank">Resend</a> to send email notifications to your users. This page describes how to get started with Resend in Knock, including necessary provider configurations and additional data you can pass through to Resend.

## Features

- Attachments support
- Delivery tracking
- Bounce support
- Knock link and open tracking
- Per environment configuration
- Sandbox mode

## Getting started

You can create a new Resend channel in the dashboard under the **Channels and sources** page in your account settings. From there, you'll need to configure the channel for each environment you have.

## Channel configuration

The following channel settings should be configured per [environment](/concepts/environments). Navigate to **Channels and sources** in your dashboard account settings, select your Resend [channel](/concepts/channels), then click "Manage configuration" under the environment that you'd like to configure.

## Recipient data requirements

To send an email notification you'll need a valid `email` property set on your recipient.

## Debugging common errors

### `Identity not found`

If you see an `Identity not found` error in your delivery logs this is because you need to verify your sending domain with Resend (the `From email address`).

## Delivery status webhooks

When enabled, Resend will send delivery status updates directly to Knock via webhooks, allowing you to track the full lifecycle of your email messages in real-time.

### Prerequisites

Before enabling delivery status webhooks, you need:

1. A verified domain in Resend
2. A Resend channel configured in Knock (see the [getting started](#getting-started) section above)
3. Access to your Resend dashboard webhook settings

### Setting up delivery status webhooks

<Steps titleSize="h3">
  <Step title="Enable delivery status webhooks in Knock">
    1. Navigate to **Channels and sources** in your Knock dashboard
    2. Select your Resend channel
    3. Click "Manage configuration" for the environment you want to configure
    4. Scroll to the "Incoming message status updates" section and enable incoming webhooks
    5. Copy the generated webhook URL - you'll need this in the next step
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add webhook endpoint in Resend">
    In the Resend dashboard, configure webhooks to send delivery events to Knock:

    1. Go to the [Webhooks section](https://resend.com/webhooks) in your Resend dashboard
    2. Click "Add Endpoint"
    3. Paste the webhook URL from Knock
    4. Select the events you want to track:
       - **email.delivered** - Tracks successful delivery
       - **email.bounced** - Tracks bounce events
    5. Click "Add Endpoint" to save
    6. Resend will automatically verify the endpoint

  </Step>
</Steps>

### Supported delivery statuses

When delivery status webhooks are enabled for Resend, Knock will update message statuses based on these Resend webhook events:

| Resend Event Type | Knock Status | Description                                                         |
| ----------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| email.delivered   | `delivered`  | The email was successfully delivered to the recipient's mail server |
| email.bounced     | `bounced`    | The email bounced due to invalid recipient or domain                |

### Troubleshooting

If delivery status updates aren't appearing in Knock:

1. **Check webhook endpoint status.** Verify the endpoint shows as "Active" in the Resend webhooks dashboard.
2. **Verify event selection.** Ensure you've enabled both `email.delivered` and `email.bounced` events.
3. **Test with verified domains.** Ensure you're sending from a verified domain in Resend.
4. **Check webhook payload.** Review webhook delivery logs in Resend to ensure events are being sent.
