Knock integrates with [Resend](https://resend.com/) to send email notifications to your users. Note: you will need an existing Resend account to set up this integration.

In this guide you'll learn how to get started sending transactional email notifications with Resend through Knock. We also cover provider configuration details.

## Features

- Attachments support
- Link and open tracking
- Per environment configuration
- Sandbox mode

## Getting started

You can create a new Resend channel in the dashboard under the {"Integrations > Channels"} section. From there, you'll need to configure the channel for each environment you have.

## Provider configuration

<Attributes>
  <Attribute
    name="API key"
    type="string*"
    description="The API key for your Resend account, available from your Resend dashboard"
  />
  <Attribute
    name="From email address"
    type="string | liquid*"
    description="The sender email address (can use Liquid tags)"
  />
  <Attribute
    name="From name"
    type="string | liquid"
    description="The sender name (can use Liquid tags)"
  />
  <Attribute
    name="JSON overrides"
    type="string | liquid"
    description="Provider API's paramater overrides"
  />
</Attributes>

## Environment default settings

The following fields are optional and, if set, will be applied to all email messages sent via this channel within the environment:

<Attributes>
  <Attribute
    name="Reply-to address"
    type="string | liquid"
    description="The reply-to email address (can use Liquid tags)"
  />
  <Attribute
    name="CC address"
    type="string | liquid"
    description="The cc email address (can use Liquid tags)"
  />
  <Attribute
    name="BCC address"
    type="string | liquid"
    description="The bcc email address (can use Liquid tags)"
  />
</Attributes>

## Recipient data requirements

To send an email notification you'll need a valid `email` property set on your recipient.

## Debugging common errors

### `Identity not found`

If you see an `Identity not found` error in your delivery logs this is because you need to verify your sending domain with Resend (the `From email address`).
