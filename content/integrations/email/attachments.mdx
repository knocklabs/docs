## How attachments work in Knock

1. Set an attachment key in your email template to tell Knock how to resolve attachments you send in the data payload of your trigger call. To set an attachment key, click the gear icon (‚öôÔ∏è) at the top of the email template editor, then set your desired key under the "Attachment key" field. This key will default to `attachments` if not specified.
2. Include one or more attachment objects in the `data` payload of your trigger call, under the configured attachment key. Each attachment object should have the content of the file to be attached as a base64 encoded value.
3. Knock automatically adds any attachments included in the attachment key of your trigger call to the emails sent by your email provider üéâ.

## The attachment object

Every attachment you send to Knock in your `data` payload should include the following properties (those marked with an `*` are required):

| Property         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`\*         | The name of the file                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `content_type`\* | A mime type for the file                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `content`\*      | The base64 encoded file content (up to 10mb)                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `content_id`     | An optional unique `Content-ID` for the attachment, which will automatically set the attachment as `inline`. Currently only supported for [SendGrid](/integrations/email/sendgrid) and [Postmark](/integrations/email/postmark). |

```js title="An example attachment object"
{
  name: "my-file.txt",
  content: myFileContent,
  content_type: "text/plain"
}
```

**Note**: each attachment object must be less than 10mb, but you should confirm whether your email provider has a lower limit.

## Sending attachments in your trigger call

Once you've specified your attachment key in your email template, the last step is to send the data along to Knock. Remember that you need to base64 encode the contents of the file.

<MultiLangCodeBlock
  title="Sending attachment data"
  snippet="workflows.trigger-with-attachment"
/>

**Note**: you can send multiple attachments for an email by including an array of attachment objects under the attachment key in your data payload.

## Sending a different attachment per recipient

If you need to send a different attachment per recipient in a workflow then you'll need to make one trigger call per recipient, such that the data payload is unique to that recipient.

```js title="Unique attachments per recipient"
import Knock from "@knocklabs/node";
const knock = new Knock({ apiKey: process.env.KNOCK_API_KEY });

const filesAndRecipients = [
  { id: "user-1", file: user1FileContents },
  { id: "user-2", file: user2FileContents },
];

filesAndRecipients.forEach(({ id, file }) => {
  knock.workflows.trigger("my-workflow", {
    recipients: [id],
    data: {
      attachment: {
        name: "Invoice.pdf",
        content_type: "application/pdf",
        content: file,
      },
    },
  });
});
```
