## How attachments work in Knock

1. Set an attachment key in your email template to tell Knock how to resolve attachments you send in the data payload of your trigger call. To set an attachment key, click the gear icon (‚öôÔ∏è) at the top of the email template editor, then set your desired key under the "Attachment key" field. This key will default to `attachments` if not specified.
2. Include one or more attachment objects in the `data` payload of your trigger call, under the configured attachment key. Each attachment object should have the content of the file to be attached as a base64 encoded value.
3. Knock automatically adds any attachments included in the attachment key of your trigger call to the emails sent by your email provider üéâ.

## The attachment object

Every attachment you send to Knock in your `data` payload should include the following properties (those marked with an `*` are required):

| Property         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `name`\*         | The name of the file                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `content_type`\* | A mime type for the file                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `content`\*      | The base64 encoded file content (up to 10mb)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `content_id`     | An optional unique `Content-ID` for the attachment. Currently only supported for [SendGrid](/integrations/email/sendgrid) and [Postmark](/integrations/email/postmark). See <a href="#referencing-attachment-files-inline" style={{ color: "var(--tgph-accent-11)", textDecoration: "underline" }}>Referencing attachment files inline</a> for more details. |
| `disposition`    | An optional disposition for the attachment (`inline` or `attachment`). Currently only supported for [SendGrid](/integrations/email/sendgrid) and [Postmark](/integrations/email/postmark).                                                                                                                                                                   |

<br/>
```js title="An example attachment object"
{
  name: "my-file.txt",
  content: myFileContent,
  content_type: "text/plain"
}
```

**Note**: each attachment object must be less than 10mb, but you should confirm whether your email provider has a lower limit.

## Sending attachments in your trigger call

Once you've specified your attachment key in your email template, the last step is to send the data along to Knock. Remember that you need to base64 encode the contents of the file.

<MultiLangCodeBlock
  title="Sending attachment data"
  snippet="workflows.trigger-with-attachment"
/>

**Note**: you can send multiple attachments for an email by including an array of attachment objects under the attachment key in your data payload.

## Sending a different attachment per recipient

If you need to send a different attachment per recipient in a workflow then you'll need to make one trigger call per recipient, such that the data payload is unique to that recipient.

```js title="Unique attachments per recipient"
import Knock from "@knocklabs/node";
const knock = new Knock({ apiKey: process.env.KNOCK_API_KEY });

const filesAndRecipients = [
  { id: "user-1", file: user1FileContents },
  { id: "user-2", file: user2FileContents },
];

filesAndRecipients.forEach(({ id, file }) => {
  knock.workflows.trigger("my-workflow", {
    recipients: [id],
    data: {
      attachment: {
        name: "Invoice.pdf",
        content_type: "application/pdf",
        content: file,
      },
    },
  });
});
```

## Referencing attachment files inline

If you're using [SendGrid](/integrations/email/sendgrid) or [Postmark](/integrations/email/postmark) as your email provider, you can set attachment files to be inline in your email template by providing a `disposition` property of `inline` on the attachment object you send in your trigger call.

### Inline image attachments

To attach image files to your email and reference them inline, add a `content_id` and `disposition` to the attachment object. You can then reference the attachment in your template using the `cid:` prefix and the `content_id` value.

```js title="An example inline image attachment"
{
  name: "my-image.png",
  content_type: "image/png",
  content: imageContent,
  content_id: "my-attachment",
  disposition: "inline"
}
```

```html title="Referencing an attachment file inline"
<img src="cid:my-attachment" />
```

### Inline calendar invitations

To set calendar files to be inline in your email message, add a `disposition` property of `inline` on the attachment object you send in your trigger call.

```js title="An example attachment object for an inline calendar invitation"
{
  name: "invite.ics",
  content_type: "text/calendar; charset=utf-8; method=REQUEST",
  content: calendarContent,
  disposition: "inline"
}
```

We also recommend that your `.ics` file include the following parameters for the best email client support:

- `METHOD:REQUEST`
- `RSVP=TRUE;ROLE=REQ-PARTICIPANT;PARTSTAT=NEEDS-ACTION` (on the `ATTENDEE`, to enable RSVPs)

## Previewing messages with attachments

The Knock dashboard does not currently support previewing the attachment files that are sent with your email messages. This means that you'll need to send a test message (via the [workflow test runner](/send-notifications/testing-workflows) or the API) to your own email inbox to see what the attachment(s) will look like.

This limitation applies to both regular attachment files and inline attachments. Any images that are sent as inline attachments will not be viewable in the dashboard.
