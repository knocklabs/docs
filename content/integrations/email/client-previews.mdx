## Overview

Email client previews allow you to test how your email notifications will render across different email clients. This feature is embedded directly in the Knock template editor, using Litmus technology to generate accurate previews without requiring you to leave the editor or send test emails.

## Features

- Preview emails in popular clients including Gmail, Outlook, and Apple Mail.
- Access previews directly within the Knock template editor.
- View rendering across multiple desktop and mobile email clients.

## Using email client previews

To access and use email client previews:

1. Open the workflow template editor for an email channel.
2. Make sure the preview pane is opened. By default, you'll see the "in browser" preview.
3. Use the toggle option at the top of the preview pane to switch to "client previews."
4. Click on any email client thumbnail to see an expanded view.

This feature uses the Litmus Instant API to generate client-specific previews.
