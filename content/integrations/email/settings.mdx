Knock email channel configurations support a number of settings. These include email-specific fields (such as `cc`, `bcc`, and `reply-to`) as well as JSON overrides to be passed in API calls to the configured provider's API endpoints.

When you configure a setting in a channel's configuration, it will be used on all instances of that channel across all workflows.

## Configuring email settings

You can override email settings on a per-channel basis, or on a per-template basis.

- **At the channel level**. The `to`, `cc`, `bcc`, and `reply-to` fields can be found in the "Overrides" section of the channel's "Settings" tab.
- **At the template level**. You'll find the email settings under the "Template settings" button.

All email configuration fields support Liquid usage. You will be able to use any variables available in your workflow trigger payloads, as well as system variables such as the current workflow, activities, and any other variables you have access to when building templates.

As an example, if you wanted to conditionally change the "From name" on an email depending on whether one is configured on the actor that triggered the notification, you'd use the following liquid in the "From name" field of your email configuration.

```js title="A From name email configuration using Liquid"
{{ actor.from_name | default: "no-reply@knock.app" }}
```

## Overriding the default `to` address

By default Knock will send your emails to the `email` property stored on the `recipient` for the workflow run. If you need to override this, you can do so by setting the `to` field in your email configuration either at the channel or the template level.

As an example, if you wanted to send all emails to a single address, you could set the `to` field at the channel level to either a static value (like `hello@example.com`) or a dynamic value (like `{{ data.email_to_override }}`).

## Setting `cc` and `bcc` addresses

The `cc` and `bcc` fields can be used to support a single or multiple addresses. In order to use several addresses on any of these fields, make sure to separate them with a comma.

<Callout

  text={

      <span className="font-bold">Liquid support.</span> You can pass multiple
      cc and bcc addresses using workflow trigger variables, and configure these
      fields to use them.
    </>
  }
/>

## Provider JSON overrides

Sometimes you may want to customize the API call Knock sends to your email provider.
A good example of this is passing custom arguments as part of the API payload.
Take an example where we're using SendGrid as our email provider. SendGrid allows sending custom arguments under the
`custom_args` key of the JSON payload of their API. By default, Knock sends some arguments using that key, such
the Knock message id. If you want to add more arguments, you can check the following image on how to add them as
JSON overrides:

<figcaption>Configuring email channel JSON overrides.</figcaption>

In this example, we want to add two arguments to the `custom_args` attribute of the API call we send to SendGrid.
In this case, the first argument will be hardcoded, and the second
argument's value will be the value of `workflow_variable`, which we expect to be passed
in the payload of the workflow trigger call.
