Knock integrates with [Postmark](https://postmark.com/) to send email notifications to your users.

In this guide you'll learn how to get started sending transactional email notifications with Postmark through Knock. We also cover provider configuration and additional data you can pass through to Postmark.

## Features

- Attachments support
- Delivery tracking
- Link and open tracking
- Per environment configuration
- Sandbox mode

## Getting started

You can create a new Postmark channel in the dashboard under the "Channels" section. From there, you'll need to configure the channel for each environment you have.

## Provider configuration

<Attributes>
  <Attribute
    name="API key"

  <Attribute

  <Attribute

  />
</Attributes>

## Environment default settings

The following fields are optional and if set, will be applied to all email messages sent via this channel within the environment:

<Attributes>
  <Attribute
    name="Reply-to address"
    type="string | liquid"
    description="The reply-to email address (can use Liquid tags)"
  />
  <Attribute
    name="CC address"
    type="string | liquid"
    description="The cc email address (can use Liquid tags)"
  />
  <Attribute
    name="BCC address"

    description="The bcc email address (can use Liquid tags)"
  />
  <Attribute
    name="JSON overrides"
    type="string | liquid"
    description="Provider API's paramater overrides"
  />
</Attributes>

## Additional data sent

Knock sends the following attributes along with your emails:

- `Meta.sender`: always set to `knock.app`
- `Meta.knock_message_id`: the message ID attached to this email
- `Tag`: the key of the workflow this message was generated from

You can learn about the role of these Postmark attributes in the [Postmark API documentation](https://postmarkapp.com/developer).

## Recipient data requirements

In order to send an email notification you'll need a valid `email` property set on your recipient.
