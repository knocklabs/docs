Our [`@knocklabs/expo`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@knocklabs/expo) library lets you create in-app notification experiences using Knock's client APIs in applications built with React Native and Expo.

The Expo library is built on top of the `@knocklabs/client` JS SDK and includes that library as an implicit dependency.

**Quick links:**

- [`@knocklabs/expo` on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@knocklabs/expo)
- [`@knocklabs/client` on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@knocklabs/client)
- [Expo SDK reference](/sdks/expo/reference)
- [Javascript SDK reference](/sdks/javascript/reference)

Using the Expo SDK it's possible to build:

- [Notification feeds](/in-app-ui/react-native/notification-feeds) that update in real time
- Notification preference control centers
- Push notification management

## Example app

Our [Expo SDK example app](https://github.com/knocklabs/javascript/tree/main/examples/expo-example) shows patterns for handling push token registration, building an in-app feed, and managing user notification preferences.

Our Expo SDK is worked on full-time by the Knock JavaScript team.
