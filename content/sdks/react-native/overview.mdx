Our [`@knocklabs/react-native`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@knocklabs/react-native) library lets you create in-app notification experiences in React Native powered applications using Knock's client APIs.

      <a href="/sdks/expo/overview">Expo SDK</a>. Our React Native SDK is meant

The React Native library is built on top of the `@knocklabs/client` JS SDK and includes that library as an implicit dependency.

**Quick links:**

- [`@knocklabs/react-native` on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@knocklabs/react-native)
- [`@knocklabs/client` on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@knocklabs/client)
- [React Native SDK reference](/sdks/react-native/reference)
- [Javascript SDK reference](/sdks/javascript/reference)

Using the React Native SDK it's possible to build:

- [Notification feeds](/in-app-ui/react-native/notification-feeds) that update in real time
- Notification preference control centers
- Push notification management

## Example app

You can find a basic example application that uses the React Native SDK [here](https://github.com/knocklabs/javascript/tree/main/examples/react-native-example). The app shows patterns for handling push token registration, building an in-app feed, and managing user notification preferences.
