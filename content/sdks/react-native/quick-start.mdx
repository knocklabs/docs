description: Get started with the Knock React Native SDK to build in-app notification experiences.
section: SDKs
---

To get started, you will need the following:

- [A Knock Account](https://dashboard.knock.app/signup)
- A public API key for the Knock environment (which you'll use in the `publishableKey`)
- An in-app feed channel with a workflow that produces in-app feed messages (optional)
- An APNS channel with a workflow that produces push notifications (optional)

## Installation

- Via NPM: `npm install @knocklabs/react-native`
- Via Yarn: `yarn add @knocklabs/react-native`

### Configuration

To configure the feed you will need:

1. A public API key (found in the Knock dashboard)
2. A user ID and an auth token

   <Callout
     emoji="ðŸ’¡"
     text={
       <>
         Auth tokens are strongly recommended for production environments and
         are required when enhanced security mode is enabled. For more
         information, see our{" "}
         <a href="/in-app-ui/security-and-authentication#authentication-with-enhanced-security">
           Security & Authentication documentation
         </a>
         .
       </>
     }
   />

3. If integrating an in-app feed, a feed channel ID (found in the Knock dashboard)
4. If integrating push notifications, an Expo channel ID (found in the Knock dashboard)

### Usage

You can integrate the feed into your app as follows:

```typescript
import {
  KnockProvider,
  KnockFeedProvider,
  NotificationFeedContainer,
} from "@knocklabs/react-native";

const YourAppLayout = () => {
  const [isVisible, setIsVisible] = useState(false);
  const notifButtonRef = useRef(null);

  return (
    <KnockProvider apiKey={process.env.KNOCK_PUBLIC_API_KEY} userId={userId}>
      {/* Optionally, use the KnockFeedProvider to connect an in-app feed */}
      <KnockFeedProvider feedId={process.env.KNOCK_FEED_ID}>
        <NotificationFeedContainer>
          <Text>Notifications go in here!</Text>
        </NotificationFeedContainer>
      </KnockFeedProvider>
    </KnockProvider>
  );
};
```

### Headless usage

Alternatively, if you don't want to use our components you can render the feed in a headless mode using our hooks:

```typescript
import {
  useAuthenticatedKnockClient,
  useNotifications,
  useNotificationStore,
} from "@knocklabs/react-native";

const YourAppLayout = () => {
  const knockClient = useAuthenticatedKnockClient(
    process.env.KNOCK_PUBLIC_API_KEY,
    currentUser.id,
  );

  const notificationFeed = useNotifications(
    knockClient,
    process.env.KNOCK_FEED_ID,
  );

  const { metadata } = useNotificationStore(notificationFeed);

  useEffect(() => {
    notificationFeed.fetch();
  }, [notificationFeed]);

  return <Text>Total unread: {metadata.unread_count}</Text>;
};
```
