## Step 1: Set up a Firebase Cloud Messaging channel in Knock

If you haven't already, create a new Firebase Cloud Messaging channel in the **Integrations** page of your Knock dashboard. Follow our [Firebase Cloud Messaging push notification guide](/integrations/push/firebase) to configure FCM with Knock using your Service Account JSON file.

## Step 2: Set up React Native Firebase

The simplest way to get started with FCM in your React Native app is to use [React Native Firebase](https://rnfirebase.io/), which simplifies the process of handling push notifications and device tokens. Follow their Getting Started guide to set up React Native Firebase in your project.

## Step 3: Add `KnockPushNotificationProvider` to your app

Ensure your app is wrapped with both `KnockProvider` and `KnockPushNotificationProvider`.

```tsx
import React from "react";
import { View } from "react-native";
import {
  KnockProvider,
  KnockPushNotificationProvider,
} from "@knocklabs/react-native";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <KnockProvider apiKey="{YOUR_KNOCK_PUBLIC_API_KEY}" userId="{YOUR_USER_ID}">
      <KnockPushNotificationProvider>
        <View> {/* Your app content here */} </View>
      </KnockPushNotificationProvider>
    </KnockProvider>
  );
}
```

## Step 4: Request permissions

Depending upon the platforms supported by your app, you may need to request permissions to receive push notifications on the user's device. See React Native Firebase's documentation on [how to request permissions on Android](https://rnfirebase.io/messaging/usage#android---requesting-permissions) and [how to request permissions on iOS](https://rnfirebase.io/messaging/usage#ios---requesting-permissions). Alternatively, consider using a third-party library such as [react-native-permissions](https://github.com/zoontek/react-native-permissions).

## Step 5: Register for push notifications

When your app launches, retrieve the device token using [React Native Firebase's `getToken` function](https://rnfirebase.io/reference/messaging#getToken). Pass this token to the `registerPushTokenToChannel` function provided by Knock's [`usePushNotifications` hook](/sdks/react-native/reference#usepushnotifications) and include the channel ID of your FCM channel.

Additionally, when your app is in the foreground, register a listener using [`onTokenRefresh`](https://rnfirebase.io/reference/messaging#onTokenRefresh) and invoke `registerPushTokenToChannel` whenever the token is refreshed.

```tsx
import { Text } from "react-native";
import { usePushNotifications } from "@knocklabs/react-native";
import messaging from "@react-native-firebase/messaging";

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { registerPushTokenToChannel } = usePushNotifications();

  useEffect(() => {
    messaging()
      .getToken()
      .then((token) =>
        registerPushTokenToChannel(token, "{YOUR_KNOCK_FCM_CHANNEL_ID}"),
      )
      .catch(console.error);

    const unsubscribe = messaging().onTokenRefresh((token) =>
      registerPushTokenToChannel(token, "{YOUR_KNOCK_FCM_CHANNEL_ID}").catch(
        console.error,
      ),
    );
    return unsubscribe;
  }, [registerPushTokenToChannel]);

  return <Text>Hello, world!</Text>;
};
```

## Step 6: Handle incoming push notifications

Listen for push notifications using React Native Firebase's [`getInitialNotification`](https://rnfirebase.io/reference/messaging#getInitialNotification) and [`onNotificationOpenedApp`](https://rnfirebase.io/reference/messaging#onNotificationOpenedApp) functions. See [React Native Firebase's Notifications guide](https://rnfirebase.io/messaging/notifications#handling-interaction) for more details on these two functions.

```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  messaging()
    .getInitialNotification()
    .then((remoteMessage) => {
      if (remoteMessage) {
        console.log("App opened via notification from quit state");
      }
    })
    .catch(console.error);

  const unsubscribe = messaging().onNotificationOpenedApp(() => {
    console.log("App opened via notification while in the background");
  });

  return unsubscribe;
}, []);
```

## Step 7: Send a test notification

Use the Knock dashboard or API to send a test notification to ensure your setup is correct. Verify that the notification appears on your device and that tapping on it triggers the expected behavior.

- **Not Receiving Notifications:** Ensure your FCM device token is correctly registered with Knock and that your device's notification settings allow push notifications from your app.
- **Handling Silent Notifications:** If implementing silent notifications, ensure that your notification payload is correctly configured to not display an alert or sound.
