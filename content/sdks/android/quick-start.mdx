description: Get started with the Knock Android SDK to build in-app notification experiences.
section: SDKs
---

To get started, you will need the following:

- [A Knock Account](https://dashboard.knock.app/signup)
- A public API key for the Knock environment (which you'll use in the `publishableKey`)
- An in-app feed channel with a workflow that produces in-app feed messages (optional)
- A Firebase Cloud Messaging channel with a workflow that produces push notifications (optional)

## Installation

You can install the Android SDK in a the following ways:

- Jitpack
- Manually

See [here](https://github.com/knocklabs/knock-android) for more information on installation.

### Initializing a Knock instance

To initialize the shared Knock instance, you are required to use your publishable key, which is identified by the prefix **`pk_`**. Additionally, if you opt to utilize our **`KnockMessagingService`** and **`KnockActivity`** for comprehensive device token registration and management, you must also include your **`pushChannelId`** during the setup process of your instance.

You should do this setup as soon as you can. Preferably within your **`Application`** class.

```kotlin
Knock.setup(context = "applicationContext", publishableKey = "your-pk", pushChannelId = "apns-channel-id")
```

### Authenticating a user

Once you've configured the shared Knock instance with your publishable key, the next step is to sign the user into Knock. This requires the **`userId`** and, for interactions with your production Knock environment, the **`userToken`**. For further details on **`userTokens`**, please refer to our [documentation](https://docs.knock.app/in-app-ui/security-and-authentication#authentication-with-enhanced-security-enabled).

We recommend you initiate the user sign-in process at the earliest point where the **`userId`** is known to you. This ensures that your application is ready to leverage Knock's features with the context of the signed-in user.

```kotlin
Knock.shared.signIn(userId = "userId", userToken = "userToken")
```
