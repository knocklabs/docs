In this section, you'll find usage guides to help you get started with the [Android SDK](https://github.com/knocklabs/knock-android).

## KnockMessagingService & KnockActivity

These classes serves as an optional base classes designed to streamline the integration of Knock into your application. By inheriting from KnockMessagingService in your FirebaseMessagingService class and the KnockActivity in your MainActivity class, you gain automatic handling of FCM Push Notification registration and device token management, simplifying the initial setup process for Knock's functionalities.

The class also provides a set of open helper functions that are intended to facilitate the handling of different Push Notification events such as delivery in the foreground, taps, and dismissals. These helper methods offer a straightforward approach to customizing your app's response to notifications, ensuring that you can tailor the behavior to fit your specific needs.

Override any of the provided methods to achieve further customization, allowing you to control how your application processes and reacts to Push Notifications. Additionally, by leveraging this class, you ensure that your app adheres to best practices for managing device tokens and interacting with the notification system on Android, enhancing the overall reliability and user experience of your app's notification features.

Key Features:

- Automatic registration for remote notifications, ensuring your app is promptly set up to receive and handle Push Notifications.
- Simplified device token management, with automatic storage of the device token, facilitating easier access and use in Push Notification payloads.
- Customizable notification handling through open helper functions, allowing for bespoke responses to notification events such as foreground delivery, and user taps.
- Automatic message status updates, based on Push Notification interaction.

```kotlin title="Example KnockMessagingService"
class ExampleMessagingService: KnockMessagingService() {
    override fun messageReceivedInForeground(message: RemoteMessage) {
        super.messageReceivedInForeground(message)

        // This is just an example of how you could present a notification with the app in the foreground.
        // You should customize this to fit your own app's needs.
        message.presentNotification(
            context = this,
            handlingClass = MainActivity::class.java,
            icon = android.R.drawable.ic_dialog_info
        )
    }
}
```

```kotlin title="Example KnockActivity"
class MainActivity : KnockComponentActivity() {
    override fun onKnockPushNotificationTappedInBackGround(intent: Intent) {
        super.onKnockPushNotificationTappedInBackGround(intent)
        Log.d(Utils.loggingTag, "tapped in background")
    }

    override fun onKnockPushNotificationTappedInForeground(message: RemoteMessage) {
        super.onKnockPushNotificationTappedInForeground(message)
        Log.d(Utils.loggingTag, "tapped in foreground")
    }
}
```
