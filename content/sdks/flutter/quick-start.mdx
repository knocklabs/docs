The Knock Flutter SDK is a client-side SDK for interacting with the Knock API and for building in-app notification experiences for Flutter applications. In this guide, we'll show some of the main ways you can interact with the SDK.

## Quick links

- [SDK on Github](https://github.com/knocklabs/knock-flutter)
- [Full reference guide](/sdks/flutter/reference)
- [Example application](https://github.com/knocklabs/knock-flutter/tree/main/example)

## Installation

You can find `knock_flutter` on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/knock_flutter).

```bash
flutter pub add knock_flutter
```

## Setup the SDK

```dart
import 'package:knock_flutter/knock_flutter.dart';

late Knock knock = Knock(const String.fromEnvironment("KNOCK_API_KEY"));
knock.authenticate("your-user-id");
```
