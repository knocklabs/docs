Our [`@knocklabs/react`](https://github.com/knocklabs/javascript/tree/main/packages/react) library lets you create notification experiences using Knock's APIs. It comes with pre-built UI components that you can use to easily get up-and-running with a fully functional notification feed experience in your product.

    </>
  }

The React library is built on-top of the `@knocklabs/client` JS SDK and includes that library as an implicit dependency.

[See a live demo](https://in-app-demo.knock.app/)

**You can also use the library to build:**

- [Floating notification feeds](/in-app-ui/react/feed)
- [Real-time notification toasts](/in-app-ui/react/toasts)
- [Notification inboxes](/in-app-ui/react/inbox)
- [Custom notification UI](/in-app-ui/react/custom-notifications-ui)
- [Notification preferences](/in-app-ui/react/preferences)
