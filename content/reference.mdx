<Section title="API Reference" slug="overview">
<ContentColumn>
The Knock API enables you to add a complete notification engine to your product. This API provides
programmatic access to integrating Knock via a REST-ful API.

</ContentColumn>
<ExampleColumn>

```bash Base URL
https://api.knock.app/v1
```

<Section title="Client libraries" slug="client-libraries">

Knock offers native SDKs in several popular programming languages:

- [Node JS](https://github.com/knocklabs/knock-node)
- [Python](https://github.com/knocklabs/knock-python)
- [Ruby](https://github.com/knocklabs/knock-ruby)
- [Go](https://github.com/knocklabs/knock-go)

<Section title="API keys" slug="api-keys">
<ContentColumn>

Knock authenticates your API requests using your account's API keys. API requests made without authentication or using an incorrect key will return a 401 error. Requests using a valid key but with insufficient permissions will return a 403 error.

You can view and manage your API keys in the Developer Dashboard. There are two types of API keys:

- Publishable keys are only meant to identify your account with Knock. They aren't secret, and can safely be made public in any of your client-side code. Publishable keys are prefixed with `pk_*`.

- Secret keys can perform any API request to Knock, they should be kept secure and private! Be sure to prevent secret keys from being made publicly accessible, such as in client-side code, GitHub, unsecured S3 buckets, and so forth. Secret keys are prefixed with `sk_*`.

Each Environment in your account has both a publishable and secret key pair. API requests will be scoped to the provided key's Environment.

</ContentColumn>
</Section>

<Section title="Authentication" slug="authentication">
<ContentColumn>

You must pass your API key to Knock as a Bearer token using the `Authorization` header.

</ContentColumn>
<ExampleColumn>

```bash Authentication header
Authorization: Bearer sk_test_12345
```

</ExampleColumn>
</Section>

<Section title="Rate limits" slug="rate-limits">
<ContentColumn>

Each endpoint in the Knock API is rate limited. Knock uses a tier system to determine the rate limit scale for each endpoint. When your request has been rate limited, the Knock API will return a `429 Too Many Requests` error in response.

Knock's default behavior scopes rate limits based on the authorizing credential used in your requests. When you use a public or private API key to authorize a request, Knock will scope the rate limit for each endpoint by the [environment](/send-and-manage-data/environments) associated with the key. If you use a signed user token as your authorizing credential, Knock will scope the rate limit by both the key's environment and the signing user. See our guide on [enhanced security mode](/in-app-ui/security-and-authentication#authentication-with-enhanced-security) for more details on working with signed user tokens.

<Section title="Batch and bulk endpoint deduplication rate limits" slug="batch-rate-limits">
<ContentColumn>

Knock's batch and bulk endpoints may also have an additional layer of rate limiting applied. For these cases, Knock will also limit the number of times you can update a specific entity over a given scale. These limits are in place to prevent too many duplicate modifications applied to the same set of entities.

When you exceed a batch deduplication rate limit, Knock will still return a success (`2xx`) response if it is able to handle the request. For any entities not updated due to a rate limit hit, Knock will return the data as it exists at request time. Knock will also include an `x-ratelimited-{param}` header. The `{param}` value will be the name of the request param within which the rate limit was applied. The value will be a comma-delimited string of the param values that were rejected due to a rate limit hit.

Knock can apply batch deduplication rate limits to all or part of a request. If Knock rejects a subset of your batch, you can expect to see the full set of requested entities in the response body, and the IDs of those that were rejected in the `x-ratelimited-{param}` header.

<Section title="Idempotent requests" slug="idempotent-requests">
<ContentColumn>

Knock supports [idempotency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence) so that requests can be retried safely without unintended side effects.

To perform an idempotent request, set an `Idempotency-Key` header on your request. This idempotency key is a unique value that you generate for each request. It is used to identify and prevent the duplicate processing of requests. If you retry a request with the same idempotency key within 24 hours from the original request, Knock will return the same response as the original request. You may use any string up to 255 characters in length as an idempotency key.

Idempotency keys can be random UUIDs, or they can have some meaning in your application. For example, if you are sending a notification after a user has placed an order, you could use a key that is a combination of the reason for the notification, the user ID, and the order ID (e.g. `order-placed:user-123:order-456`). If your user then cancels the order, you could use an idempotency key like `order-cancelled:user-123:order-456`. This will ensure each type of notification is only sent once, even if your system retries the request multiple times.

If you are making calls to Knock from a job queue, the ID of the job can be a good choice for an idempotency key. If the job fails and is retried, the same idempotency key will be used.

<Section title="Bulk endpoints" slug="bulk-endpoints">
<ContentColumn>

Knock exposes several endpoints that enqueue and return a `BulkOperation`. These endpoints perform their logic asynchronously, and you use the `BulkOperation` record to track progress.

In some cases, a bulk endpoint will accept a large set of entities to perform some action upon. In others, a bulk endpoint will accept a set of filter parameters and then execute an action across a large set of data on your account.

See the [Bulk operations section](#bulk-operations) for more information on parsing and polling bulk operation statuses.

</ContentColumn>
</Section>

<Section title="Pagination" slug="pagination">
<ContentColumn>

All top-level API resources expose support for bulk fetches via a `list` method. For instance, you can [list users](#list-users), [list objects](#list-objects) in a collection, and [list subscriptions](#list-subscriptions).

Resources that return multiple entities support the same cursor-based pagination to interact with the resources, using `after`, `before`, and `page_size` parameters as well as returning a common format for the metadata associated with the page.

<Section title="Errors" slug="errors" direction="column">
<ContentColumn>

Knock uses standard [HTTP response codes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Web/HTTP/Status) to indicate the success or failure of your API requests.

- `2xx` success status codes confirm that your request worked as expected.

- `4xx` error status codes indicate an error caused by incorrect or missing request information (e.g. providing an incorrect API key).

- `5xx` error status codes indicate a Knock server error.

<Section title="Workflows" slug="workflows">
<ContentColumn>

A Workflow orchestrates the delivery of messages to your end users. When you configure a workflow you'll determine which channels its messages should route to, what those messages should look like on each channel, as well as any functions—batch, throttle, digest—you want applied to the messages prior to delivery. A workflow is triggered by a `trigger` call, usually when something occurs in your product that you want your users to know about (e.g. a new comment.)

<Section title="Triggering a workflow with inline identifications" slug="trigger-workflow-inline-identify">
<ContentColumn>

In the `recipients` and `actor` fields in a trigger call, you can optionally include maps full of properties describing a user or an object. These can be properties describing a brand new user/object, or properties describing an update to an existing one. When this data is present in a notify call, Knock will persist it as part of processing the workflow. This is comparable to direct calls to the [identify user](#identify-user) or [set object](#set-object) APIs.

See our guides on inline identification [for users](/send-and-manage-data/users#3-inline-identification) and [for objects](/send-and-manage-data/objects#3-set-objects-inline) for more details on this use case.

as such return information that is required on the client to do so**
