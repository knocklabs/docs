## An overview

HTTP requests are a way to create and save HTTP requests so that you and your team can reuse them as instances across multiple workflows and broadcasts. Updates to these HTTP requests cascade down to their instances, making it possible to centrally manage common configurations. HTTP requests are [a versionable resource](/concepts/commits) in Knock.

## Creating an HTTP request

To create an HTTP request, navigate to the **HTTP requests** page in the Knock dashboard from the main sidebar. Then, click the "Create request" button. After creation, this will take you to the request editor where you can specify the details of your request.

## Using an HTTP request

HTTP requests are usable in both workflows and broadcasts. In this example, we'll be using an HTTP request in a workflow.

    To use an HTTP request in a workflow, first navigate to the workflow where you'd like to use it. Then, create an fetch step by selecting it in the step selection menu.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Edit the request">
    After creating the fetch step, make sure it is selected and click "Edit request" in the side panel.

  <Step title="Select the request template">
    Once within the request editor, you can select the "Apply template" button to inherit the details of that reusable HTTP request. Now, **the request will be in an uneditable state** with the details of the reusable HTTP request applied.

</Steps>

If you need to make changes to the request, it's recommended to edit the underlying HTTP request itself via the HTTP request page, that way changes will apply to all instances of the request. However, if you need to make changes to just this instance, you can click the "Detach instance" button from the dropdown to remove the reusable HTTP request usage, and enable an editable state.

## Versioning

HTTP requests are environment-specific, so you can safely edit a request in one environment without affecting production workflows. To use a request in a different environment, you have to make sure the request is committed and promotedto the environment you want to use it in.

Read more about [versioning in Knock here](/concepts/commits).

## Safely Deleting

When an HTTP request is deleted, resources currently using the request will continue to function safely. The fetch step will remain linked to the request, but the request will no longer be available for editing or selection.
