## An overview
Guides enable you to power in-product messaging, everything from paywalls and badges, to one-time announcements and banners, using your own components. Your engineering team controls the UI via a new API, while your content team manages content, targeting, and activation rules in the Knock dashboard.

Guides are reactive and data-driven. At runtime, you can pass data from your app into a guide to influence both its content and targeting. For example, you might show a guide only when `currentProject.assetCount` exceeds 25. The API evaluates the current user and returns any eligible guides, enabling personalized, real-time experiences for your users.
