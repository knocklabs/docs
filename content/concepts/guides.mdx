## An overview

Guides enable you to power in-product messaging, everything from paywalls and badges, to one-time announcements and banners, using your own components. Your engineering team controls the UI via a new API, while your content team manages content, targeting, and activation rules in the Knock dashboard.

Guides are reactive and data-driven. At runtime, you can pass data from your app into a guide to influence both its content and targeting. For example, you might show a guide only when `currentProject.assetCount` exceeds 25. The API evaluates the current user and returns any eligible guides, enabling personalized, real-time experiences for your users.

## Guides analytics

Guides include an analytics summary that highlights key metrics over the last N days, based on your account's [retention period](/manage-your-account/data-retention). These metrics include:

- **Audience**: The total number of users in the target audience.
- **Seen**: The number of users who saw this guide.
- **Interacted**: The number of users who interacted with this guide.
- **Archived**: The number of users who archived this guide.

## Guides pricing

Guides usage is priced using **engaged users**, which is the distinct number of users who have **seen** or **engaged** with a guide in the billing period.

Messages produced by guides are **not** counted towards your message sent usage.

You can learn more about guide engagement in our [guide engagement documentation](/in-app-ui/guides/handling-engagement).

      If you're an enterprise customer, and you don't have guides included in
      your current agreement, you'll have the same guides usage limits as our
      starter plan. You can use guides up to the limit, at which point we ask
      that you contact us to increase your limit.
