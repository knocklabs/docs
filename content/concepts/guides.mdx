## An overview

Guides enable you to power in-product messaging, everything from paywalls and badges, to one-time announcements and banners, using your own components. Your engineering team controls the UI via a new API, while your content team manages content, targeting, and activation rules in the Knock dashboard.

Guides are reactive and data-driven. At runtime, you can pass data from your app into a guide to influence both its content and targeting. For example, you might show a guide only when `currentProject.assetCount` exceeds 25. The API evaluates the current user and returns any eligible guides, enabling personalized, real-time experiences for your users.

## Guides analytics

Guides include an analytics summary that highlights key metrics over the last N days, based on your account's [retention period](/manage-your-account/data-retention). These metrics include:

- **Audience**: The total number of users in the target audience.
- **Seen**: The number of users who saw this guide.
- **Interacted**: The number of users who interacted with this guide.
- **Archived**: The number of users who archived this guide.

To learn more, see our [message status documentation](/send-notifications/message-statuses).

## Guides pricing

Guides are measured as **engaged users**, which is the distinct number of users who have **seen** or **engaged** with a guide in the billing period.

Messages produced by guides are **not** counted towards against your message sent quota, and guide users are **not** counted towards your notified users quota.

You can learn more about guide engagement in our [guide engagement documentation](/in-app-ui/guides/handling-engagement).
