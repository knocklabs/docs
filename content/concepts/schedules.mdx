A schedule allows you to automatically trigger a workflow at a given time for one or more recipients. You can think of a schedule as a managed, recipient-timezone-aware cron job that Knock will run on your behalf.

Some examples of where you might reach for a schedule:

- A digest notification where your users can select the frequency in which they wish to receive the digest (every day, every week, every month).
- A reminder notification for a specific event or deadline, sent only once at a given date and time.

## How schedules work

1. [Create a workflow](/designing-workflows) that you wish to run in the future.
2. Using the API, [set a repeating schedule](#scheduling-workflows-with-recurring-schedules-for-recipients) or a [non-recurring schedule](#scheduling-workflows-with-one-off-non-recurring-schedules-for-recipients) for one or more recipients for the workflow.

Knock will preemptively schedule workflow runs for the recipient(s) that you've provided, and execute those runs at the scheduled time. At the end of the workflow run (and in case of using a recurring schedule), a future scheduled workflow will be enqueued based on the recipient's next schedule.

## Scheduling workflows with recurring schedules for recipients

To schedule a workflow for a recipient using recurring schedules, you must first have a valid, committed workflow in your environment. We can then set a schedule with `repeats` for one or more recipients (up to 100 at a time).

```typescript
const { Knock } = require("@knocklabs/node");
const knock = new Knock(process.env.KNOCK_API_KEY);

const schedules = await knock.workflows.createSchedules("park-alert", {
  recipients: ["jhammond", "esattler", "dnedry"],
  repeats: [
    // Repeat daily at 9.30am only on weekdays
    {
      frequency: "daily",
      days: "weekdays",
      hours: 9,
      minutes: 30,
    },
  ],
  data: { type: "dinosaurs-loose" },
  tenant: "jpark",
});
```

## Scheduling workflows with one-off, non-recurring schedules for recipients

To schedule a workflow for a recipient using a non-recurring schedule, you must also have a valid and committed workflow in your environment. We can then set a schedule with the `scheduled_at` property, specifying the moment when this workflow should be executed.

```typescript
const { Knock } = require("@knocklabs/node");
const knock = new Knock(process.env.KNOCK_API_KEY);

const schedules = await knock.workflows.createSchedules("park-alert", {
  recipients: ["jhammond", "esattler", "dnedry"],
  scheduled_at: "2023-12-22 17:45:00Z",
  data: { type: "dinosaurs-loose" },
  tenant: "jpark",
});
```

## Modeling repeat behavior

Every recurring schedule accepts one or more repeat rules, which allow you to express complex rules like:

- Every Monday at 9am.
- Every weekday at 10.30am.
- Every other Monday, Tuesday, and Friday at 6pm.
- Every year at midnight.

A schedule repeat has the following type structure:

```typescript
enum DaysOfWeek {
  Mon = "mon",
  Tue = "tue",
  Wed = "wed",
  Thu = "thu",
  Fri = "fri",
  Sat = "sat",
  Sun = "sun",
}

enum RepeatFrequency {
  Monthly = "monthly",
  Weekly = "weekly",
  Daily = "daily",
  Hourly = "hourly",
}

type ScheduleRepeatProperties = {
  frequency: RepeatFrequency;
  interval?: number;
  day_of_month?: number;
  days?: DaysOfWeek[] | "weekdays" | "weekends";
  hours?: number;
  minutes?: number;
};
```

### Example repeat rules

To illustrate how to model a repeat rule, here are some common examples:

**Every Monday at 9am**

```
{
  "frequency": "weekly",
  "days": ["mon"],
  "hours": 9
}
```

**Every weekday at 10.30am**

```
{
  "frequency": "weekly",
  "days": "weekdays",
  "hours": 10,
  "minutes": 30
}
```

**Every other Monday, Tuesday, and Friday at 6pm**

```
{
  "frequency": "weekly",
  "interval": 2,
  "days": ["mon", "tues", "fri"],
  "hours": 18,
  "minutes": 00
}
```

## Updating schedules

Up to 100 recipient schedules can be updated in a single call. Keep in mind that the properties passed in will be applied to all schedules.

```typescript title="Updating schedules"
const { Knock } = require("@knocklabs/node");
const knock = new Knock(process.env.KNOCK_API_KEY);

const schedules = await knock.workflows.updateSchedules({
  schedule_ids: workflowScheduleIds,
  data: { foo: "bar" },
});
```

## Removing schedules

Up to 100 schedules can be deleted at a time, causing any already enqueued schedules to be cancelled for a recipient.

```typescript title="Removing schedules"
const { Knock } = require("@knocklabs/node");
const knock = new Knock(process.env.KNOCK_API_KEY);

const schedules = await knock.workflows.deleteSchedules({
  schedule_ids: workflowScheduleIds,
});
```

## Listing scheduled workflows

Schedules can be listed per recipient (for a user or an object), or for an individual workflow:

```typescript title="Listing schedules for a user"
const { Knock } = require("@knocklabs/node");
const knock = new Knock(process.env.KNOCK_API_KEY);

const { entries: schedules } = await knock.users.getSchedules("sam");
```

<br />

```typescript title="Listing schedules for a specific workflow"
const { Knock } = require("@knocklabs/node");
const knock = new Knock(process.env.KNOCK_API_KEY);

const { entries: schedules } = await knock.workflows.listSchedules(
  "workflow-key",
);
```

Schedules include a `next_occurrence_at` property which computes the **next time that a schedule will be executed**.
Schedules also include a `last_occurrence_at` property which indicates when was the last time the schedule was executed.

## Workflow data in a scheduled workflow run

Workflows in Knock are triggered either via an API call or via a Source event, both of which will pass the `data` associated. In the case of a scheduled workflow, the workflow will be triggered with an empty data payload by default.

There are 2 ways in which to get data into each of your scheduled workflow runs:

1. **Define static data passed to every triggered workflow on a schedule.** We can include an optional `data` payload when we create our schedule. Any workflow runs triggered by that schedule will include the data payload within their workflow run scope.
2. **Fetch data from an HTTP endpoint to use in your workflow.** You can use an [fetch function step](/designing-workflows/fetch-function) to fetch data for a triggered scheduled workflow to “enrich” the data available with information from a remote server (via HTTP).

## Executing schedules in a recipient's timezone

Knock supports a `timezone` property on the recipient that automatically makes a scheduled workflow run timezone aware, meaning you can express recurring schedules like "every monday at 9am in the recipient's timezone." Recipient timezones must be a [valid tz database time zone string](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones), like `America/New_York`.

## Frequently asked questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How can I start my repeating schedule at a particular time?">
    You can use the `scheduled_at` attribute to start your schedule at a
    particular time in the future.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How can my scheduled workflows use dynamic template data?">
    You can use an HTTP fetch step to fetch data in your workflow as the first
    step to execute to fetch dynamic template data used in your workflow.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How can I set static data per workflow schedule?">
    When scheduling a workflow for one or more recipients, you can optionally
    provide a static set of `data` which will be passed to the invoked workflow.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I cancel a scheduled workflow?">
    At any point before the scheduled workflow is invoked you can unschedule the
    workflow for one or more recipients. If a workflow has already run, then
    [normal workflow cancellation
    rules](/send-notifications/canceling-workflows) take effect.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I still debug a scheduled workflow?">
    You’ll see workflow runs that initiated from a scheduled workflow in the
    list of workflow runs. From there you can select the debugger and debug a
    given workflow.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I model exclusion rules in my repeat logic?">
    Currently no, but we'll be looking to add this feature in the near future.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I change a recurring schedule to be non-recurring?">
    Yes, you can update the schedule to change from recurring to non-recurring
    (or vice versa). This can be done by removing the `repeats` property and
    setting `scheduled_at` to the desired one-time execution time.
