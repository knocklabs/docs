## Get started

To get started, enable translations for your account. Go to ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù under your account name in the left sidebar and click ‚ÄúEnable translations‚Äù.

Next you'll need to set a default `locale`. Knock uses the default `locale` when it can't find a translation for a given recipient‚Äôs `locale`.

Once you've set your default `locale`, you should see a new ‚ÄúTranslations‚Äù page under ‚ÄúDevelopers‚Äù in the sidebar. This is where you‚Äôll be working with your translations.

## Basic usage

[Translations](/mapi#translations-overview) are JSON objects that contain the text for your messages in various locales. For example, let‚Äôs say you have a customer order notification that you want to localize for French and English users.

```json title="en translation"
{
  "OrderReady": "Your order is ready.",
  "OrderDelayed": "Your order is delayed."
}
```

<br />

```json title="fr translation"
{
  "OrderReady": "Votre commande est pr√™te.",
  "OrderDelayed": "Votre commande est retard√©e."
}
```

Once you have those translations created for the `en` and `fr` locales, you can reference their translation strings in your message templates using the `t` filter:

```json title="Message template editor"
<p> {{ "OrderReady" | t }} </p>
```

Your users must have a `locale` property set for the helper to find translations in their locale, otherwise Knock will use the default locale. You can set a user's `locale` with the [identify endpoint](/api-reference/users/update).

## Translation methods: filter vs. tag

There are two methods available to you to translate your message templates: the `t` filter and the `t` tag.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="The t filter">
    The `t` filter is used to reference existing translation files. It works best when you have translations that are already created and you want to reference them in your message templates.

    ```json title="Using t filter in a message template"
    {{ "congratulationsMessage" | t: recipientName: recipient.name }}
    ```

    In the example above, the `t` filter finds the recipient's `locale` and looks for the `congratulationsMessage` key in the translation file for that locale. It then replaces the `recipientName` variable with the recipient's name.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="The t tag">
    The `t` tag is used to write templates in their default language and automatically generate translations for additional locales. It is best when you have less technical users authoring templates, and you want to automatically generate translations for their templates behind the scenes.

    ```json title="Using t tag in a message template"
    {% t %}Congratulations, {{ recipient.name }}!{% endt %}
    ```

    In the example above, we author content in our English default language, wrap that content in our `t` tag, and Knock automatically generates translation files for us behind the scenes.

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

We cover how to use the `t` filter and `t` tag in more detail below.

## Using the `t` filter

You can use `t` filter to reference your translations from within a message template. The `t` filter also allows you to use variables, other filters, and special pluralization rules.

### Variables and interpolation

You can use variable interpolation in your translations.

```json title="en translation"
{
  "comment": "New comment from {{ actorName }} on your post {{ postName }}.",
  "like": "{{ actorName }} liked your photo {{ photoTitle}}!"
}
```

You can pass variables to the `t` filter:

```json title="Message template editor"
<p> {{ "like" | t: actorName: actor.name, photoTitle: likedPhoto.title }} </p>
```

### Pluralization

Translations support pluralization rules. When you pass the `count` variable to a translation, it looks for pluralization keys in your translation. Those keys are `zero`, `one`, and `other`. You don‚Äôt need to reference these in the template. If you pass the `count` variable, it will evaluate it and choose one for you.

```json title="en translation"
{
  "orders": {
    "shipping": {
      "zero": "You have no orders currently being shipped.",
      "one": "You have one order being shipped.",
      "other": "You have {{ count }} orders being shipped."
    }
  }
}
```

To pluralize content in a message template, pass the `count` variable:

```json title="Message template editor"
<p> {{ "orders.shipping" | t: count: count }} </p>
```

- If the count is 0, it will choose `zero`, unless `zero` does not exist and then it will use `other`.
- 1 corresponds to `one`, and everything else will fall under `others`.

### Other filters in combination

You can still use other filters in combination with `t` but you‚Äôll use them **after** you use the `t` filter.

For example, to titlecase a translation:

```json title="Message template editor"
<p> {{ "congratulationsMessage" | t | titlecase }} </p>
```

### Namespaced translations

When you create a translation, you can supply an optional ‚Äúnamespace.‚Äù The namespace helps organize translations of the same locale so you can keep similar concepts together. Below you'll see examples of how to reference namespaced translations from your message templates.

Let's start with a translation with a namespace of `shipping`:

```json title="en:shipping translation"
{
  "backordered": "Your order has been backordered so shipping will be delayed.",
  "shipped": "Your order has been shipped.",
  "canceled": "Your shipment has been canceled."
}
```

To access the contents of the `shipping` translation in your message template you‚Äôll reference the namespace before the key followed by a colon (‚Äù:‚Äù):

```json title="Message template editor"
<p> {{ "shipping:canceled" | t }} </p>
```

This can be helpful if you use the `canceled` key else where in your translations so that there isn‚Äôt a collision. For example, if you had a `payments` translation like this:

```json title="en:payments translation"
{
  "success": "Your payment has been processed.",
  "canceled": "Your payment was canceled."
}
```

You would reference it with the `payments` namespace as well:

```json title="Message template editor"
<p> {{ "payments:canceled" | t }} </p>
```

And if you had a translation that wasn‚Äôt namespaced, say the `en` translation, you would simply use the key alone. All together in a template, it would look like this:

```json title="Message template editor"
<p> Hello, </p>
<p> {{ "payments:canceled" | t }} </p>
<p> {{ "shipments:canceled" | t }} </p>
<p> {{ "canceled" | t }} </p>
```

### Nested translations

You can create whatever JSON structure you need to hold your translations.

Given the following translation:

```json title="en translation"
{
  "customers": {
    "orders": {
      "beenReceived": "Have you received your order?",
      "survey": "How was your order?"
    },
    "reminder": {
      "paymentInfo": "Remember to update your payment information!"
    }
  }
}
```

You can access the content with dot-syntax like this:

```json title="Message template editor"
<p> {{ "customers.orders.beenReceived" | t }} </p>
```

The same goes for namespaced translations. If the above translation was in a translation named `services` , you would do the following:

```json title="Message template editor"
<p> {{ "services:customers.orders.beenReceived" | t }} </p>
```

## Using the `t` tag

Knock also provides an editor-friendly `t` tag which you can use to write templates in your default language. Translation files for any supported languages will be automatically generated in the background when you commit a workflow.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Write your message templates">
    Wrap content you want to translate in a <code>t</code> tag. Any content between the opening and closing t tags will be used as the content for your account's default locale.

    ```liquid title="Message template"
    <p> {% t %}Have you received your order?{% endt %} </p>
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Commit your workflow">
    After you commit your workflow, Knock will look for changes to your message templates and update a system translation file. Translation keys will be automatically generated based off of the content of the <code>t</code> tag.

    A Knock bot will commit these changes to your account with a message indicating which workflow generated the new translations.

    ```json title="System translation file"
    {
      "Have you received your order?": "Have you received your order?"
    }
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Translate the default content into additional locales">
    You can then translate the default content into additional locales by manually editing your translation files or programmatically updating them using the Knock API and a translation service.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Translation version control

Translations follow the same version control flow in Knock as workflows and layouts. You create them in Development and then promote them to subsequent environments. You can archive translations that are no longer needed.

<Callout
  emoji="üö®"
  text={
    <>
      <span className="font-bold">Remember:</span> in order to see translation
      updates in your template previews, you'll need to commit them to your
      development environment first.
    </>
  }
/>

## Locale prioritization

When Knock renders a template for a given user and encounters our `t` helper, it runs through the following locale prioritization:

1. Language + region (e.g. `fr-BE`)
2. Language (e.g. `fr`)
3. Default locale (e.g. `en`)

Regional locales take precedence over language locales. If a translation is not found in the user‚Äôs locale, Knock will fall back to the default locale.

## Automate localization with our CLI

In addition to working with translations in the Knock dashboard, you can programmatically create and update translations using the [Knock CLI](/developer-tools/knock-cli) or our [Management API](/developer-tools/management-api).

If you manage your own translation files within your application, you can automate the creation and management of Knock translations so that they always reflect the state of the translation files you keep in your application code.

The Knock CLI supports both JSON and the Portable Object (PO) file formats. When using PO files, the Knock CLI will handle converting between the Knock translation format and the PO format.

The Knock CLI can also be used to commit changes and promote them to production, which means you can automate Knock translation management as [part of your CI/CD workflow](/developer-tools/integrating-into-cicd).

### Translation directory structure

When translations are pulled from Knock, they are stored in directories named by their locale codes. Their filename will be their locale code. Any namespaced translations will prepend the namespace to the filename, with `.` used as a separator.

```txt title="Local translation files structure"
translations/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ en/
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ en.json
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ admin.en.json
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ en-GB/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ en-GB.json
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tasks.en-GB.json
```

If you're migrating your local translation files into Knock, you can arrange them using the file structure above and then push them into Knock with a single command using [`knock translation push --all`](/cli#translation-push). Each `<locale>.json` or `<namespace>.<locale>.json` file should follow the structure defined [here](/mapi#translations-object).

You can learn more about automating translation management in the [Knock CLI reference](/cli). Feel free to <a href="mailto:support@knock.app">contact us</a> if you have questions.
