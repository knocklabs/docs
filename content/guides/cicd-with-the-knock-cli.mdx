With the [Knock CLI](/developer-tools/knock-cli), you can add Knock directly into your existing CI/CD pipeline in order to automate the promotion of changes to Workflows, Layouts, and Translations between [environments](/concepts/environments) during testing and deployment. 

This guide assumes that you have [created](/concepts/environments#create-additional-environments) a ‚ÄúStaging‚Äù environment in Knock in addition to the Development and Production environments that are provided by default. It also assumes that you have [installed the Knock CLI](/cli#installation) on your local machine.

## Local development

With the Knock CLI, you can pull resources from the Knock dashboard and develop them locally using the [`knock workflow pull --all`](/cli#workflow-pull), [`knock layout pull --all`](/cli#email-layout-pull), and [`knock translation pull --all`](/cli#translation-pull) commands. You can also work with specific resources by name rather than using the `--all` flag.

Once you‚Äôre ready to send your updates back to Knock‚Äôs Development environment, you can push ([`knock workflow push --all`](/cli#workflow-push)) and commit ([`knock commit`](/cli#commit-all)) changes directly from the command line in the same way that you would save and commit them in your dashboard. You can also perform both of these actions at once by using the `--commit` flag on any `push` command.

      any uncommitted changes that are made to a Knock resource and pushed to Knock 
      can be overwritten by another user who is working on the same resource. 
      It‚Äôs important to <code>commit</code> any changes that you want to persist while working 
      in the Development environment.
