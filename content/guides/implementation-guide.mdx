Knock‚Äôs APIs and developer tools make it easy to migrate your notification templates, delivery logic, recipient data, and user preferences into Knock. In this guide, we will walk you through planning and executing your Knock integration from start to finish.

If you‚Äôre new to Knock, we recommend taking a look at our [What is Knock?](/getting-started/what-is-knock) page to learn more about our product and how it can be used. You may also want to take a closer look at various [Concepts](/concepts/overview) as you familiarize yourself with the product.

## Migrating data into Knock to power your notifications

Using Knock as your notifications service means storing all of the logic for your notifications (the who, when, and where of delivery) in Knock. We offer APIs and developer tools that make your migration a smooth and efficient process:

- A [Management API](/developer-tools/management-api) that allows you to work programmatically with the same resources that you create in your Knock dashboard (like [Workflows](/concepts/workflows) and their associated message templates, email [Layouts](/integrations/email/layouts), and [Translations](/concepts/translations)).
- A command line interface ([Knock CLI](/developer-tools/knock-cli)) that wraps the Management API, allowing you to work with your dashboard resources from the command line while you‚Äôre developing.
- [Bulk endpoints](/reference#bulk-endpoints) to upsert large amounts of data in a single API request (more on specific endpoints below).

      <strong>The Knock environment model.</strong> Knock uses the concept of
      logically-separated <a href="/concepts/environments">environments</a> in
      order to ensure that development occurs separately from your production
      environment and that sensitive user data only exists in production. Your
      Knock account comes with two environments (Development and Production) by
      default, but you can add custom environments between them if you need
      additional environments in Knock to mirror your own development lifecycle.
      Keep the environment model in mind when planning the migration for each of
      the resources below.
    </>
  }
/>

While there is no one-size-fits-all approach to planning a migration to Knock, we recommend the following order as a starting point to ensure that any resources which are dependencies of other resources are migrated first:

<Steps titleSize="h3">
  <Step title="Channels">
    The first thing you‚Äôll need to do in order to send notifications through Knock is to set up the downstream providers that deliver your messages. In Knock, we refer to these services as [Channels](/concepts/channels).

    Channels are configured under the **Integrations** tab in your Knock dashboard. You can see a full list of supported channel types and providers [here](/integrations/overview).

    In addition to first-party integrations with message delivery platforms, Knock also offers convenient connections to customer data platforms (CDPs) and reverse ETL providers to bring your data into Knock ([Sources](/integrations/sources/overview)).

    You‚Äôll want to configure your channels prior to building any workflows so that you can set the correct delivery methods for each of your notifications.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Workflows">
    Next, you‚Äôll start building your [Workflows](/designing-workflows/overview). Workflows in Knock serve as containers for all of the logic and message templates associated with a given notification in your system. When you‚Äôre ready to start sending notifications, you‚Äôll do so by [triggering](/send-notifications/triggering-workflows) these workflows.
    
    <Callout
      emoji="üë£"
      text={
        <>
          <strong>Incremental migration.</strong> Sometimes circumstances will require an incremental migration of your notifications into Knock while maintaining your legacy notification system. In these cases, we recommend migrating your notifications by individual use cases/events rather than all use cases for a single delivery channel at a time. The latter approach will often require triggering both your legacy system and Knock for a single event in order to notify your users in the correct places, which can be difficult to maintain and iterate on as you work to complete your migration.
        </>
      }
    />

    Knock‚Äôs environment model means that you‚Äôll be creating all of your workflows and other dashboard resources in your Development environment, where you‚Äôll commit and then promote changes to higher environments (like Production). Read more [here](/concepts/environments).

    You can assign one or more [categories](/concepts/workflows#workflow-categories) to your workflows. These can be used to power recipient preferences (which we will cover in more detail below).

    Workflows are constructed from a trigger step, channel steps, and optional function steps. To learn more about creating the messages that are delivered by your workflows, you‚Äôll want to become familiar with the building blocks of your notifications content:

    - [Message template editor](/designing-workflows/template-editor/overview). The message template editor is where you‚Äôll build the content of your notifications. You can use [Variables](/concepts/variables) to inject dynamic content at runtime.
    - [Partials](/designing-workflows/partials). Partials are content blocks that you can reuse across multiple templates.
    - [Layouts](/integrations/email/layouts). Layouts are the "frame" of your email notifications, where you define shared structure and styles.
    - [Translations](/concepts/translations). Send message content in a user's preferred language with translations.

    Workflows and their building blocks can be created in your Knock dashboard or programmatically with our [Management API](/mapi).

  </Step>
  <Step title="Users">
    Once you‚Äôve configured the logic of the notifications that you‚Äôd like to send, you‚Äôll need to give Knock the necessary data about your users in order to deliver those notifications.

    The [User](/concepts/users) object in Knock has a number of (optional) reserved attributes like `name`, `email`, and `phone_number`, but it can also store any number of custom properties which can be used in the logic and templates of your workflow; for example, you might want to deliver different messages based on a user‚Äôs `role`. These attributes can be updated at any time with subsequent upserts.

    We offer a variety of ways to identify your users to Knock, so you‚Äôll want to look over our guide on [identifying recipients](/managing-recipients/identifying-recipients) before you solidify your migration plan. If you‚Äôre planning to send notifications to [push](/integrations/push/overview) or [chat](/integrations/chat/overview) channels, you‚Äôll also need to review our guide on [setting channel data](/managing-recipients/setting-channel-data) to ensure that we can deliver your messages to the right place.

    Remember, the Knock environment model means that you‚Äôll need to identify production users directly into your Knock Production environment.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Objects and Subscriptions">
    After you‚Äôve planned the migration of users into Knock, you may need to consider advanced use cases for non-user recipients (like a public Slack channel) or a resource in your system (like an order that has been placed) that doesn‚Äôt fit neatly under the concept of a ‚Äúuser.‚Äù In Knock, these resources can be modeled as [Objects](/concepts/objects).

    [Subscriptions](/concepts/subscriptions) are an extension of objects and express the relationship between a [recipient](/concepts/recipients) (the subscriber) and an object. When you trigger a notification to an object recipient, Knock will also fan out individual workflow runs to **any recipients that are subscribed to the object**. This is especially useful for examples like the order placement use case mentioned above: you can trigger an ‚Äúorder updates‚Äù workflow with an object that represents the order as the recipient, and we‚Äôll notify any subscribed Users about the change without you needing to resolve the list of recipients in your system.

      </Accordion>
    </AccordionGroup>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Tenants">
    If your notifications should be scoped to a particular workspace or organization, you‚Äôll need to implement [Tenants](/concepts/tenants) in your Knock integration. A `tenant` can be applied as context to a workflow trigger in order to [apply per-tenant branding](/concepts/tenants#custom-branding), [per-tenant preferences](/concepts/tenants#per-tenant-user-preferences-and-tenant-preference-defaults), and [scope in-app feed messages to particular tenants](/concepts/tenants#scoping-in-app-feeds).

  </Step>
  <Step title="Preferences">
    Once your recipients (both users and objects) and tenants have been migrated to Knock, you‚Äôll want to consider delivery preferences for your notifications to give your users control of where and when they receive updates from your product. For more information on building a preference center in your app, check out the section on [Completing your client-side integration](#completing-your-client-side-integration) below.

    Knock‚Äôs powerful [Preferences](/preferences/overview) API allows your users to opt out of notifications based on the notification‚Äôs delivery `channel_type`, the `category` of the notification, the specific notification `workflow`, or a combination of these properties. You can also extend these preferences to be [tenant-specific](/preferences/tenant-preferences) or to [evaluate conditionally](/preferences/preference-conditions) at runtime.

    You can set environment-level default preferences (for example, maybe a given workflow should require a user to manually opt in to receive those notifications) as well as tenant-specific default preferences that will be overridden by a recipient‚Äôs individual preferences.

    </AccordionGroup>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Schedules">
    Finally, for any notifications that you‚Äôll send on a recurring basis or reminders that should be sent at a specific future date, our [Schedules](/concepts/schedules) feature should be considered before you‚Äôre ready to finalize your integration.

    Schedules can be set, updated, and deleted via API. Although they are recipient-specific, you can create a schedule for up to 100 recipients at a time.

- [Modeling Users, Objects, and Tenants](/guides/modeling-users-objects-and-tenants)

## Completing your client-side integration

Certain implementations will require some client-side work to [build in-app UI](/in-app-ui/overview) in order to complete your integration. Knock provides [out of the box UI components](/in-app-ui/react/overview#pre-built-components) that you can use, but you can also [implement our in-app feed API and React hooks in a headless way](/in-app-ui/react/custom-notifications-ui) if you‚Äôd like to bring your own components and styles.

Here are some use cases that will require additional client-side planning:

- **In-app messaging.** If you‚Äôre planning to use Knock-powered in-app messaging (whether that‚Äôs a notification feed for web or mobile, other in-product notifications like modals and banners, or custom components powered by our [Message types](/in-app-ui/message-types) feature), you‚Äôll need to build a way to display those messages to your users. For more information on your preferred language or framework, visit the **Building In-app UI** section of our navigation menu.
- **User preferences.** In order to power [user preferences](/preferences/overview) in Knock, you need to [build a preference center](/in-app-ui/react/preferences) in your application that gives your user control over the types of notifications they receive.
- **Chat app authentication.** Some delivery channels like Slack require a way for your users to authenticate your app or bot into their workspace. Knock provides drop-in React components ([SlackKit](/in-app-ui/react/slack-kit) and [TeamsKit](/in-app-ui/react/teams-kit)) for both Slack and Microsoft Teams that will help manage the process of authentication and storing the necessary information (access tokens, etc.) as [channel data](/managing-recipients/setting-channel-data) in Knock so that we can deliver your notifications.

## Testing and observability

Testing your notifications and insight into any errors that occur are a key part of developing and deploying your Knock integration. Knock offers many tools and resources to help you ensure that your users are receiving the right messages at the right time:

- Guides on tools for [testing](/send-notifications/testing-workflows) and [debugging](/send-notifications/debugging-workflows) workflows.
- A [Postman collection](/developer-tools/knock-and-postman) to test against our API.
- An optional [sandbox mode](/integrations/overview#sandbox-mode) on each of your channels that allows you to generate and preview messages without sending them to your downstream provider for delivery.
- [Delivery and engagement statuses](/send-notifications/message-statuses) for all of the notifications sent through Knock.
- [Outbound webhooks](/developer-tools/outbound-webhooks/overview) for real-time updates on events that occur within Knock.
- An **Analytics** page in your Knock dashboard for insight into the messages you‚Äôre sending across different workflows and delivery channels.

## Going to production

You‚Äôre finally ready to move to production ‚Äì congratulations! Before you flip the switch and sit back to admire your work, here are a few last-minute items to check off your list:

- Be sure to update your application‚Äôs [API keys](/developer-tools/api-keys) to point to your Knock Production environment.
- Ensure that all of your work has been [promoted](/concepts/commits#promoting-commits) to your Production environment.
- If you‚Äôre using in-app messaging, [generate a signing key](/in-app-ui/security-and-authentication#1-generate-the-signing-key) and enable enhanced security mode for client-side requests in your Production environment. Both of these actions can be completed by navigating to **Developers** > **API Keys** in your Knock dashboard‚Äôs Production environment.

As always, we‚Äôre here to help. If you have any questions or run into issues as you build with our product, we hope you‚Äôll let us know! Email us at support@knock.app and we‚Äôll be more than happy to assist you.

Knock on. ü§ò
