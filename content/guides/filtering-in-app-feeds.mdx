When building an in-app notifications UI, you may wish to filter the notifications a user has received to increase the relevancy of the notifications displayed. This can be useful to power per-tenant notifications in a multi-tenant SaaS application or per-resource notifications to show contextual notifications inside your product.

In this guide, we walk through how to do this by filtering the feed API using the `defaultFeedOptions` which will filter all of the results returned, including the real-time updates sent to the in-app feed and the badge count for unseen or unread notifications.

      Default values can also be overridden when calling the <code>fetch</code>{" "}
      function as well.

## Filtering by tenant

In a multi-tenant SaaS application, individual users might belong to one or more tenants, meaning the notifications they see should be scoped to the tenant they are currently viewing.

For example, imagine we have a user `jane` in a document editing app. Jane's user profile is connected to multiple workspaces; `acme-inc` and `superior-products`. When Jane is active in the `acme-inc` workspace, she should only see notifications that are relevant for that workspace.

We include this concept in Knock as [Tenancy](/send-and-manage-data/tenants), where workflow triggers can be ‚Äútagged‚Äù with a particular tenant identifier, which can be used to apply tenant overrides and to scope in-app notifications by the tenant. Let's see how this works in practice.

```js Triggering our workflow with a tenant
await knock.workflows.trigger("new-comment", {
  reipients: ["jane"],
  data: {
    pageId: page.id,
    commentId: comment.id,
  },
  tenant: workspace.id,
});
```

Now when we render our in-app feed we can scope the feed by the tenant that our user is currently active in:

```javascript Rendering our feed with the tenant filter
// Passed to our component
<KnockFeedProvider
  feedId={process.env.KNOCK_FEED_CHANNEL_ID}
  defaultFeedOptions={{ tenant: "acme-inc" }}
/>;

// Passed to the `useNotifications` hook as `FeedClientOptions`
useNotifications(knockClient, process.env.KNOCK_FEED_CHANNEL_ID, {
  tenant: "acme-inc",
});
```

By default, filtering by a tenant will include all notifications on the feed that include that tenant or any notifications sent without a tenant identifier. If you need different behavior here, you can pass `has_tenant: true` which, when combined with the `tenant` filter, will return only notifications for that tenant.

## Filtering by workflow

Sometimes you might want to only show an individual workflow's notifications within an in-app feed for a user. You can use the `source` filter to achieve this. Let's look at an example.

In our document collaboration application, we only want to return all notifications produced by the `new-comment` workflow. To do so, we can set the `defaultFeedOptions` source to be `new-comment`:

```js Filtering our in-app feed by source
// Passed to our component
<KnockFeedProvider
  feedId={process.env.KNOCK_FEED_CHANNEL_ID}
  defaultFeedOptions={{ source: "new-comment" }}
/>;

// Passed to the `useNotifications` hook as `FeedClientOptions`
useNotifications(knockClient, process.env.KNOCK_FEED_CHANNEL_ID, {
  source: "new-comment",
});
```

It's important to note here that at this time, we don't support filtering by multiple sources.

## Filtering by `data`

You can filter the feed by properties in the `data` payload to your trigger step. This is a powerful and flexible way to query the feed data you can use to match against entities in your system. Let's look at an example.

Imagine that we want to show all of the comment notifications the current user has received for a given `page` in our document editing app. In our workflow trigger, we might send the internal identifier from our system as `pageId` in the `data` payload:

```js Triggering a workflow with data
await knock.workflows.trigger("new-comment", {
  reipients: recipientIds,
  data: {
    pageId: page.id,
    commentId: comment.id,
  },
});
```

Now when we're filtering the feed to be rendered in our application, we can pass the `trigger_data` filter to `defaultFeedOptions`.

```js Filtering our in-app feed by trigger data
// Passed to our component
<KnockFeedProvider
  feedId={process.env.KNOCK_FEED_CHANNEL_ID}
  defaultFeedOptions={{ trigger_data: { pageId } }}
/>;

// Passed to the `useNotifications` hook as `FeedClientOptions`
useNotifications(knockClient, process.env.KNOCK_FEED_CHANNEL_ID, {
  trigger_data: { pageId },
});
```

This approach also has some caveats you should be aware of:

- You can only filter by top-level keys and values in your data payload, meaning it's not possible to query `data.foo.bar` but is possible to query `data.foo`
- You can only match absolute values for the keys (e.g. no partial matches or other comparison operators are supported)

## Learn more about feed filtering

You can see all of the filtering options that the feed takes in the [API reference](/reference#get-feed). These are exposed directly to the feed via the `FeedClientOptions` type that's supported in the constructor for the feed to apply defaults, or in each individual fetch function if you need to override the defaults on an individual fetch basis.
