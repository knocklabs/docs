HTML partials are reusable components that can be used across any of your email templates. You can use HTML partials in Knock to create an email design system to empower your product and marketing teams to create consistent, brand-compliant emails.

Learn more about partials in the [Partials overview](/template-editor/partials/overview) page.

## Enabling HTML partials as blocks

In Knock's visual email editor, blocks are the building blocks you use to compose your email templates. By default, Knock comes with a number of prebuilt blocks (e.g. buttons, dividers, text, images, etc.). You can extend these with your own custom HTML partials by enabling them as blocks.

To enable an HTML partial as a block, you can set the "Enable as block" property when creating or editing the partial. Enabling as a block will ensure that the partial is displayed in the blocks menu in the visual editor.

When enabling a partial as a block, you can also set the icon that's displayed for the partial in the visual editor.

<Callout
  type="info"
  title="Note:"
  text={
    <>
      You can also disable any of the prebuilt HTML blocks that come with Knock
      by going to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Templates</strong>.
    </>
  }
/>

## Schemas for HTML partials

HTML partials support the ability to include schemas that define the fields that can be used in the partial. If you're used to a component way of thinking, you can think of the schema as the "props" for the partial.

You can create a schema for an HTML partial by clicking the "Edit schema" button in the partial overview page. The schema editor allows you to define the fields that are displayed in the partial's block in the visual editor.

```json title="An example schema for an HTML partial"
[
  {
    "type": "text",
    "key": "title",
    "label": "Title"
  },
  {
    "type": "boolean",
    "key": "show_warning",
    "label": "Show warning icon"
  },
  {
    "type": "select",
    "key": "icon",
    "label": "Icon",
    "settings": {
      "options": [
        { "label": "Skull", "value": "skull-icon.svg" },
        { "label": "Heart", "value": "heart-icon.svg" }
      ],
      "default": "skull-icon.svg"
    }
  }
]
```

## Editing HTML partial content

HTML partials display a preview alongside the editor. Open the preview by clicking the "Preview" button or using the `Cmd + ]` keyboard shortcut on Mac, or `Ctrl + ]` on Windows.

- Select an [email layout](/integrations/email/layouts) to preview the partial within.
- Use the `<style>` tag to add CSS to your partial, which will be inlined when rendering your email messages.
- Edit the placeholder variable values in the preview sidebar. These values are just for the preview and will not be used in your final messages. The preview text will also appear alongside the variable name in the code editor typeahead information.

## Isolating CSS within partials

HTML partials support the ability to include isolated CSS styles within the partial template that are included within your emails **only** when the partial is used within a template.

<Callout
  type="info"
  title="Note:"
  text={
    <>
      Partial styles can still be affected by global styles in your email
      layout, especially if you're inlining CSS within your emails.
      <br />
      <br />
      In the case that there is a conflict between the global style in an email layout
      and the styles provided on a partial, the partial styles will take precedence.
    </>
  }
/>

This is a powerful feature that allows you to create reusable components with consistent styles, without having to worry about stuffing your email layout with CSS that is only used in a single partial.

Here's an example of how it works. Note that you may include multiple `<style>` tags in a partial, as long as they are contained within the same parent element.

```html title="HTML partial with isolated CSS"
<style>
  .partial-css {
    color: red;
  }
</style>

<style>
  @media all and (max-width: 480px) {
    .partial-css p {
      display: block !important;
      width: 100% !important;
      text-align: center !important;
    }
  }
</style>

<div class="partial-css">
  <p>This is a partial CSS example.</p>
</div>
```

When you include this partial in an email template, either via a render tag or as a block in the visual editor, the CSS from this partial will be extracted and included within the `<head>` of the compiled email template. Styles are deduplicated and are only included at-most once in the final email template.
