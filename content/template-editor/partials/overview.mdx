Partials are reusable pieces of content you can use across any of your channel templates. [HTML partials](/template-editor/partials/html-partials) can be enabled as "blocks" for use in Knock's drag-and-drop email editor.

In this page, we'll walk through how to create partials and use them in your templates using Knock's code editor or visual editor.

## Managing partials

### Creating and editing partial properties

To get started, navigate to **Content** > **Partials** in the main sidebar where you can create a new partial.

When creating or editing partials, you can use the following properties:

| Property      | Description                                                                                                         |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Name`        | A name for your partial.                                                                                            |
| `Key`         | A unique key for your partial. Cannot be edited after creation.                                                     |
| `Type`        | The type of content you want to create. One of HTML, markdown, plaintext, or JSON. Cannot be edited after creation. |
| `Description` | An optional description of your partial.                                                                            |
| `Is block`    | Whether or not to enable this partial as a block within the visual editor (HTML partials only).                     |
| `Icon name`   | An icon to display for this partial within the visual editor.                                                       |

<br />

Partials are environment-specific and follow the same [version control model](/version-control/commits) as the rest of Knock.

### Creating partial content

After creating a partial, you can edit its content in the code editor.

You can include Liquid variables in your content which will be scoped to your partial. When using the partial in a template, you can pass in values for these variables. To include a variable in your partial, use the following syntax: `{{ variable_name }}`.

<Callout
  type="warning"
  title="Note:"
  text={
    <>
      Partials must be committed (or promoted) before they can be used by
      templates in a given environment. Templates will always use the published
      version of a partial.
      <br />
      <br />
      If you're using a partial that is not yet committed while editing a template,
      you will not see your latest changes.
    </>
  }
/>

### Updating existing partial content

To update the content of an existing partial, you can return to the partial's code editor.

When you commit or promote your changes, they will be immediately applied to all templates that use the partial in that environment. If you add or remove variables from your partial, you'll want to be sure to update the input values for those variables in any layouts or message templates that use your partial before promoting your changes to higher environments.

### Archiving partials

Partials can be archived from the "Partials" page or from a specific partial's details page.

<Callout
  type="alert"
  title="Note:"
  text={
    <>
      If an archived partial is used in a template, it will continue to render
      until the workflow containing that template is published again.
      <br />
      <br />
      After the workflow has been published, the partial will not render in your
      messages.
    </>
  }
/>

## Using partials in templates

Partials can be used in templates with the code editor or visual editor. You can also include partials in other partials. Knock will render partials recursively up to a maximum depth of 5.

<Callout
  type="alert"
  title="Partial variable inputs are treated as plaintext values by default."
  text={
    <>
      This means that booleans, lists, and other JSON values will be treated as
      strings when passed directly as a partial input value.
      <br />
      <br />
      If you use an HTML partial that is enabled as a block, you can create an optional{" "}
      <a href="/template-editor/partials/schema-reference">schema</a> for your partial
      to set input types other than plaintext, like JSON. See the <a href="#frequently-asked-questions">
        frequently asked questions
      </a> below for common implementation patterns for working with structured data
      in a partial.
    </>
  }
/>

### In the code editor

Use partials by using the render tag with the following syntax: `{% render 'partial_key' %}`. You can also use the partial button in the toolbar to insert a partial.

Pass variables into your partial using the following syntax: `{% render 'partial_key', variable_name: 'value' %}`. You can pass in plaintext values or Liquid expressions like `{% render 'partial_key', variable_name: data.variable_name %}`.

The Knock render tag does not support the `for` and `with` modifiers.

To replicate the `for` modifier, use the Liquid `for` block.

```liquid title="Partials in a loop"
{% for item in data.items %}
  {% render 'partial_key', variable_name: item.value %}
{% endfor %}
```

To replicate the `with` modifier, use the `{% assign %}` tag to re-assign a variable.

```liquid title="Alternative to the 'with' modifier"
{% assign item = data.item %}
{% render 'partial_key', variable_name: item.value %}
```

### In the visual editor

[HTML partials](/template-editor/partials/html-partials) can be used in the visual editor if they are enabled as blocks. Add a partial to your template by dragging it from the "Custom blocks" section of the sidebar into the template.

Click a custom block to open the inspect panel to edit variable values. You can enter a plaintext value or a Liquid expression like `{{ data.variable_name }}`.

## Frequently asked questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why can't I see my partial in the editor or preview?">
    To use a partial in the visual editor, it must be an HTML partial and enabled as a block.

    Partials must be committed before they can be used
    by templates in a given environment. Templates will always use the
    published version of a partial.

    If you're using a partial that is not yet committed while editing a template, you will not see your latest changes.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="I want to use structured JSON from my trigger data in my partial. How can I reference an object or array in a partial?">
    Because partial variable inputs are treated as plaintext values by default, you need to take an extra configuration step to directly pass a JSON object or array of items to a partial variable and then iterate over them within the partial's content.

    You have two options, depending on your use case:

    **1. Create a schema for your HTML partial and set the variable's input type to JSON.**

    When you create a [schema](/template-editor/partials/schema-reference) for your HTML partial, you can set the input type for a given variable to `json`. This will preserve the structure of the object or array of items that is passed in.

    For example, if you want a partial to render a list of items, you can create a schema for your partial and pass your list to the partial input like this:

    ```json title="A schema for an HTML partial's 'items' variable"
    [{
      "type": "json",
      "key": "items",
      "label": "Items list",
      "settings": {
        "required": true,
        "description": "A list of items to render",
        "schema": {
          "type": "array",
          "items": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
              "name": { "type": "string" },
              "value": { "type": "string" }
            },
            "required": ["name", "value"]
          }
        }
      }
    }]
    ```

    ```liquid title="Passing a list of items to the partial's 'items' input"
    {{ data.items_list }}
    ```
    Then, in the partial you can reference the list of items directly:
    ```liquid title="Partial content with structured data"
    <ul>
      {% for item in items %}
        <li>{{ item.name }}: {{ item.value }}</li>
      {% endfor %}
    </ul>
    ```
    <br />
    **2. Use Knock's Liquid helpers to transform your input data into a JSON string.**

    For use cases where you don't want to create a schema or you want to pass JSON into a different input type, you can use Knock's `json` [Liquid helper](/template-editor/reference-liquid-helpers) to transform your input data into a JSON string. Then, you can use the `from_json` helper within your partial to transform the JSON string back into a Liquid object that you can reference.

    For example, if you want a partial to render a list of items, you can pass your list to the partial input like this:

    ```liquid title="Transforming your input data into a JSON string"
    {{ data.items_list | json }}
    ```

    You can provide the logic to convert the JSON string back into a Liquid object and iterate over the items within your partial:

    ```liquid title="Partial content with deserialized structured data"
    {% assign items = input | from_json %}
    <ul>
      {% for item in items %}
        <li>{{ item.name }}: {{ item.value }}</li>
      {% endfor %}
    </ul>
    ```

    You can follow a similar pattern for working with your full `data` payload, `recipient`, or other object [variables](/template-editor/variables) that are available in the workflow run scope.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I use dynamic boolean values from my trigger data in a partial?">
    Yes! However, you'll need to be careful with how you configure them in your partial to ensure that they evaluate the way you expect. 
    
    Because variable inputs for partials are plaintext values by default, booleans will be interpreted as strings when passed directly into a partial. This means that an input value of the boolean `false` will be treated as the string `"false"` in your partial's content, which evaluates as truthy in Liquid.
    
    If you're working with an HTML partial and you create a [schema](/template-editor/partials/schema-reference), you can set your variable's input type to `json`. This will preserve the `true` or `false` boolean value that is passed in.
    
    For any other input type, you can use the `from_json` [Liquid helper](/template-editor/reference-liquid-helpers) to transform the input string back into a boolean value:

    ```liquid title="Use a boolean value in a partial"
    {% assign boolean_value = input | from_json %}
    {% if boolean_value %}
      <p>The value is true.</p>
    {% endif %}
    ```

    Alternatively, you can use a Liquid expression to check the string value of the boolean input:

    ```liquid title="Check a dynamic string value in a partial"
    {% if boolean_value == "true" %}
      <p>The value is true.</p>
    {% endif %}
    ```

    Because empty strings are also truthy in Liquid, if you'd like to check whether or not a value was provided to a partial at runtime you can use the `blank` object:

    ```liquid title="Check if an input value exists"
    {% if input_value != blank %}
      <p>The input value is not an empty string.</p>
    {% endif %}
    ```

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I reference template editor variables like `recipient`, `current_message`, or `workflow` within a partial's content?">
    Not directly. Liquid variables in your partials are scoped to the partial itself, and serve as placeholders for values that you'll configure within your message templates that use the partial.

    To reference [variables](/template-editor/variables) like `recipient`, `current_message`, or `workflow` within a partial, you can use a placeholder variable in your partial and configure the input value in the template editor to reference these values.

    ```liquid title="Use a recipient property in a partial"
      {% render 'partial_key', recipient_name: recipient.name %}
    ```
    <br />
    See the FAQ above on how to reference structured data (like a full `recipient` object) in a partial.
