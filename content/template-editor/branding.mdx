## Set custom branding

You can set branding for your account via the dashboard under the **Settings** > **Branding** page. From here, you can set the logo, icon, primary color, and primary contrast color.

It's also possible to set any number of custom branding properties as key-value pairs by clicking the "Add variable" button, or by using the bulk editor to set multiple variables at once.

Any branding variables you set will be available under the `vars.branding.*` namespace in your templates, layouts, and HTML partials.

<Table
  headers={["Property", "Description"]}
  rows={[
    ["vars.branding.logo_url", "The URL of the logo to use for your brand."],
    ["vars.branding.icon_url", "The URL of the icon to use for your brand."],
    ["vars.branding.primary_color", "The primary color to use for your brand."],
    [
      "vars.branding.primary_color_contrast",
      "The primary contrast color to use for your brand.",
    ],
  ]}
/>

## Per-tenant branding

Knock supports setting custom branding for each tenant, via the dashboard or programmatically via the API. Using per-tenant branding lets you override the account-level branding for all messages sent within the context of that tenant.

## Using branding variables in templates

Once you've set your branding variables, you can use them within your templates using the `vars.branding.*` namespace. These variables are available in your templates, layouts, and HTML partials.

```liquid title="Using a branding variable in CSS"
<style type="text/css">
  .brand-color {
    color: {{ vars.branding.primary_color }};
  }

  .accent-color {
    color: {{ vars.branding.accent_color }};
  }
</style>
```
