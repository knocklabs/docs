## Previewing templates

The preview pane in the template editor will show you an approximation of how your template will render, using the properties that you've set within the state pane as inputs.

If you need to adjust the properties that are used in the preview, or see what the template will look like for a different recipient or tenant, editing the data in the state pane will automatically cause the preview to update.

## Sending test messages

You can send a test message by clicking the "Run a test" button in the top right of the template editor. From here, you can select a recipient and provide any of the data that you'd like to pass to the template.

<Callout
  type="info"
  title="Note:"
  text="Running a test will execute the entire workflow that is associated with the template. This means that any steps that are configured to run as part of the workflow will also be executed as part of the test, including any delays."
/>

## Debugging template errors

If Knock cannot render your template, you'll see an error message in the preview pane. Most commonly, you'll see this error when you've got invalid Liquid syntax in your template that's preventing the template from being rendered.

<Callout
  type="warning"
  title="Template render errors can halt workflow execution at runtime."
  text={
    <>
      When a template fails to render during a workflow run (typically due to
      missing or malformed trigger <code>data</code> values), Knock will retry
      the step up to 3 times. If all attempts fail, the entire workflow run is
      halted. See our{" "}
      <a href="/send-notifications/debugging-workflows#understanding-workflow-execution-behavior">
        debugging workflows documentation
      </a>{" "}
      for more details.

      You can help avoid this issue by leveraging our <a href="/designing-workflows/validating-trigger-data">trigger data validation feature</a>.

    <p>
      If you're seeing the "Powered by Knock" branding appear multiple times in
      your email notifications, it's because you're double wrapping your email
      template in HTML.
