      <strong>Note:</strong> the Knock management API only provides access to
      the resources managed in <strong>the Knock dashboard</strong>, such as
      workflows, templates, translations and commits.
      <br />
      <br />
      All other concepts within the Knock notification engine are accessed through
      the <a href="/api-reference">Knock API</a>, which you use to trigger workflows,
      identify users, and manage preferences.
    </>
  }
/>

The Knock management API provides you with a programmatic way to interact with the resources you create and manage in your Knock dashboard, including workflows, templates, layouts, translations and commits. It's separate from the [Knock API](/api-reference) and only provides access to a limited subset of resources.

You can use the Knock management API to:

- Create, update, and manage your Knock workflows and the notification templates within those workflows.
- Create, update and manage your [email layouts](/integrations/email/layouts).
- Create and manage the [translations](/concepts/translations) used by your notification templates.
- Create, update, and manage your [partials](/designing-workflows/partials).
- Commit and promote changes between your Knock environments.

The management API authenticates with a Bearer authentication mechanism using a [service token](/developer-tools/service-tokens) generated on your account.

Note: [environment-level API keys](/developer-tools/api-keys) should never be used to authenticate with the management API. To authenticate with the management API, generate a [service token](/developer-tools/service-tokens).

<ContentColumn>

Knock uses standard [HTTP response codes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Web/HTTP/Status) to indicate the success or failure of your API requests.

- `2xx` success status codes confirm that your request worked as expected.
- `4xx` error status codes indicate an error caused by incorrect or missing request information (e.g. providing an incorrect API key).
- `5xx` error status codes indicate a Knock server error.
