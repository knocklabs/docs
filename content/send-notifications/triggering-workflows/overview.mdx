"Triggering" a workflow that you design within Knock executes it to run for one or more recipients you specify. Workflows can be triggered in these ways:

- By a [direct API call](/send-notifications/triggering-workflows/api) to the `trigger` endpoint
- By a [source event](/send-notifications/triggering-workflows/events)
- On a [recurring, or one-off schedule](/send-notifications/triggering-workflows/schedules)
- When a user becomes [a member of an audience](/send-notifications/triggering-workflows/audiences)

      **Important:** triggering a workflow may not always result in sent messages. Recipients can opt out of notifications through their `preferences`. Knock handles all [preference-based opt-outs](/preferences/overview) automatically.

## Conditionally executing a workflow trigger

A trigger step can have one or more [step conditions](/designing-workflows/step-conditions) that determine if the workflow executes. When conditions evaluate to false, the workflow terminates and no other steps execute.

## Controlling workflow trigger frequency

Sometimes you need to limit how often a recipient runs through a workflow. For example, you might want an account signup workflow to run only once per recipient. Workflow trigger frequency controls this behavior.

Trigger frequency lets you set if a workflow should run every time or at most once per recipient. By default, workflows trigger every time for a recipient.

When you specify "Once per recipient" frequency, you can include the tenant in this control. This ensures your workflow triggers once per-recipient, per-tenant.

## Frequently asked questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What happens when I trigger a workflow whose status is set to Inactive?">
    A workflow whose [status](/concepts/workflows#workflow-status) is set to
    `Inactive` will return a `workflow_inactive` [error](/reference#error-codes)
    when triggered and will not generate any workflow recipient runs.
