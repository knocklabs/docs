Schedules allow you to express complex repeating schedules for your workflow triggers so that you can trigger workflows on a one-off or a recurring basis for one or more recipients.

You can think of a schedule as a managed, recipient-timezone-aware cron job that Knock will run on your behalf.

## Creating a schedule

You can create a workflow schedule via the API. Schedules cannot be created in the Knock dashboard.

```typescript title="Creating a schedule for multiple recipients"
import Knock from "@knocklabs/node";
const knock = new Knock({ bearerToken: process.env.KNOCK_API_KEY });

const schedules = await knock.workflows.createSchedules("park-alert", {
  recipients: ["jhammond", "esattler", "dnedry"],
  repeats: [
    // Repeat daily at 9.30am only on weekdays
    {
      frequency: "daily",
      days: "weekdays",
      hours: 9,
      minutes: 30,
    },
  ],
});
```

## Providing per-recipient schedule data

It's possible to provide per-recipient schedule data to your workflow runs by setting the `data` property on each schedule created via the API. When your schedule runs, the data provided will be set on the workflow run for each recipient.

## Reviewing scheduled workflow runs

You can see all scheduled workflow runs under the **Schedules** section of a given workflow. Please note that this tab will only display if there are recipient schedules configured for the workflow.
