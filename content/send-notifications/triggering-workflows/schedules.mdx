Schedules let you trigger workflows on a one-off or recurring basis for recipients. Each schedule functions as a managed, recipient-timezone-aware cron job that Knock runs for you.

## Creating a schedule

Create workflow schedules through the API—the Knock dashboard does not support schedule creation.

```typescript title="Creating a schedule for multiple recipients"
const { Knock } = require("@knocklabs/node");
const knock = new Knock(process.env.KNOCK_API_KEY);

const schedules = await knock.workflows.createSchedules("park-alert", {
  recipients: ["jhammond", "esattler", "dnedry"],
  repeats: [
    // Repeat daily at 9.30am only on weekdays
    {
      frequency: "daily",
      days: "weekdays",
      hours: 9,
      minutes: 30,
    },
  ],
});
```

## Providing per-recipient schedule data

Set the `data` property on each schedule created via the API to provide per-recipient schedule data. This data is set on the workflow run for each recipient when the schedule runs.

## Reviewing scheduled workflow runs

View all scheduled workflows under the "Schedules" section of the workflow—schedules appear only when recipients have scheduled workflows.
