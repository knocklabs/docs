Audience workflow triggers allow you to execute a workflow run when a user is added to a specific audience.

An audience is a collection of users who share a common characteristic. For example, you might have an audience of users who have signed up for a paid plan, or an audience of users who have made a purchase in the past 30 days.

To use audience triggers, you'll need to have an [audience](/concepts/audiences) created in Knock. You can create an audience by going to the "Audiences" section in the dashboard and clicking the "Create audience" button.

## Configuring an audience trigger

You can configure an audience trigger by selecting the "Audience" trigger type in the workflow builder and then selecting the audience you'd like to trigger the workflow on.

Remember: you must have an audience created in Knock before you can use it as a trigger source.
