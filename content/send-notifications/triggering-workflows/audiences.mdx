Audience workflow triggers execute a workflow run when a user joins a specific audience.

An audience consists of users who share a common characteristic, such as users on a paid plan or users who made a purchase in the past 30 days.

To use audience triggers, you need an [audience](/concepts/audiences) created in Knock. Create an audience in the "Audiences" section of the dashboard.

## Configuring an audience trigger

Configure an audience trigger by selecting "Audience" trigger type in the workflow builder and selecting your target audience.

Remember: you must have an audience created in Knock before you can use it to trigger workflows.
