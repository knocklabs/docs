Events from customer data platforms like [Segment](/integrations/sources/segment) or direct HTTP webhook integrations trigger workflows.

Event-triggered workflows decouple notifications from your backend systemsâ€”enabling non-developers to configure notifications based on business events in your product.

Event-triggered workflows need at least one configured [Source](/integrations/sources/overview) connected to Knock.

## Configuring an event trigger

Create and manage event triggers in the "Sources" section under "Developers" or directly in the workflow builder's "Trigger" step.

In the Trigger step sidebar with events connected to Knock, select "Event" from the dropdown menu. Choose an event to trigger this workflow and map critical workflow fields to incoming event payload fields.
