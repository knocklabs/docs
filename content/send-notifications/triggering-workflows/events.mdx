Events from customer data platforms like [Segment](/integrations/sources/segment) or direct HTTP webhook integrations trigger workflows.

Event-triggered workflows decouple notifications from your backend systemsâ€”enabling non-developers to set up and configure notifications based on business events in your product.

Event triggered workflows require that you have one or more [Sources](/integrations/sources/overview) configured and connected to Knock.

## Configuring an event trigger

You can create and manage event triggers for your workflows in the "Sources" section (under "Developers" in the sidebar) or directly from the workflow builder when you click the "Trigger" step.

From the Trigger step sidebar, if you have events connected to Knock you'll see the option to switch the trigger type to "Event" from the dropdown menu. Once here, you can select an event that when received will trigger this workflow. You can also map the critical fields needed to run a workflow to the fields that will be in the incoming event payload.

## Frequently asked questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I trigger a workflow for multiple recipients from a single event?">
    Yes, it's possible to override the default behavior of a source event
    trigger to point the trigger to a property on the event that resolves to a
    list of recipients.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I cancel a workflow run triggered by an event?">
    Yes, you can cancel any workflow that contains a pause step (batch, delay, or fetch function).
    The ability to cancel depends on the workflow structure, not how it was triggered.
    See our guide on [canceling workflows](/send-notifications/canceling-workflows) for details.
