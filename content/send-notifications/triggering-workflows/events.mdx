Workflows can be triggered by a stream of incoming events, from a customer data platform like [Segment](/integrations/sources/segment), or from a direct HTTP webhook integration.

Triggering workflows via events gives you a powerful way to decouple your notification workflows from your backend systems, allowing non-developers in the organization the ability to setup and configure notifications driven by the business events happening in your product or service.

Event triggered workflows require that you have one or more [Sources](/integrations/sources/overview) configured and connected to Knock.

## Configuring an event trigger

You can create and manage event triggers for your workflows in the "Sources" section (under "Developers" in the sidebar) or directly from the workflow builder when you click the "Trigger" step.

From the Trigger step sidebar, if you have events connected to Knock you'll see the option to switch the trigger type to "Event" from the dropdown menu. Once here, you can select an event that when received will trigger this workflow. You can also map the critical fields needed to run a workflow to the fields that will be in the incoming event payload.

## Frequently asked questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I trigger a workflow for multiple recipients from a single event?">
    Yes, it's possible to override the default behavior of a source event
    trigger to point the trigger to a property on the event that resolves to a
    list of recipients.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I cancel a workflow run triggered by an event?">
    No, it's not currently possible to cancel a workflow run triggered by an
