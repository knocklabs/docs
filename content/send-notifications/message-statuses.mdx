The [Message](/concepts/messages) model tracks notifications delivered to recipients through specific channels. Each message has delivery and engagement statuses. Knock records status changes as Message Events, which integrate with [outbound webhooks](/developer-tools/outbound-webhooks/overview).

Knock tracks two status types:

- **Delivery status**—Tracks successful delivery to providers and recipients. These statuses are mutually exclusive, hierarchical, and managed by Knock during delivery.
- **Engagement status**—Tracks recipient interactions with notifications. Messages can have multiple engagement statuses or none. Knock manages some engagement statuses automatically, while others require manual updates through the API.

## Delivery status

Each channel step in a triggered workflow creates a Message for each recipient. Knock then delivers these messages through channel-specific providers (e.g., SendGrid for email). Delivery statuses track the message lifecycle.

View delivery history in the "Logs" tab of the message detail view. The "Delivery status" field displays the current message status.

<figcaption>Figure 1—The Knock message delivery status lifecycle.</figcaption>

The diagram shows the delivery status lifecycle. Messages have one delivery status at a time, with channel-specific status availability.

Delivery statuses follow a hierarchy, affecting comparisons in [message status conditions](/designing-workflows/step-conditions#message-status-conditions).

Each status is detailed below in ascending order of precedence, including channel-specific limitations.

### 1) Undelivered

Message failed to reach the provider and will not be retried. Check message delivery logs to debug provider connection issues. See [message delivery retries](/send-notifications/delivering-notifications#retry-logic) for details on retry logic.

### 2) Bounced

Message reached the provider but bounced due to invalid recipient data. No further retry attempts. Check message delivery logs and [message delivery retries](/send-notifications/delivering-notifications#retry-logic) for troubleshooting.

### 3) Delivery attempted

Message delivery failed but may be retried if the error is retryable and within retry limits. Check message delivery logs and [message delivery retries](/send-notifications/delivering-notifications#retry-logic) for details.

### 4) Queued

Message awaits delivery to provider, either as first attempt or retry. Messages outside send windows remain queued until scheduled send time.

### 5) Not sent

Message processed but not sent because channel is in [sandbox mode](/integrations/overview#sandbox-mode).

### 6) Sent

Message successfully reached delivery provider. Provider handles final delivery to recipient. Knock awaits delivery confirmation.

Channel-specific `sent` status meanings:

- **Chat**—Message reached destination chat platform
- **Email**—Message reached delivery provider, awaiting recipient confirmation
- **In-app**—Skips to [`delivered`](#7-delivered) status via Knock Feed API
- **Push**—Message reached destination push platform
- **SMS**—Message reached delivery provider, awaiting recipient confirmation
- **Webhook**—Skips to [`delivered`](#7-delivered) status on `2xx` response

### 7) Delivered

Delivery provider confirmed message reached recipient.

Channel-specific `delivered` status meanings:

- **Email**—Message reached recipient's email service provider
- **In-app**—Message reached recipient's feed
- **Push**—Status remains at `sent` (no delivery tracking). Use mobile app handler with `knock_message_id` to update [engagement status](#engagement-status)
- **SMS**—Message reached recipient's SMS provider (tracking varies by provider). See [SMS provider guides](/integrations/sms/overview)
- **Chat**—Status remains at `sent` (no delivery tracking). Usually indicates successful delivery
- **Webhook**—Message reached webhook endpoint

## Engagement status

Engagement statuses track recipient interactions with delivered notifications. Key characteristics:

- **Multiple statuses possible**—Messages can have zero, one, or multiple engagement statuses (e.g., both `seen` and `marked as read`)
- **Hierarchical structure**—Status hierarchy affects [message status step conditions](/designing-workflows/step-conditions#message-status-conditions)
- **Mixed management**—Knock manages statuses automatically for:
  - In-app feeds via [React SDK](/in-app-ui/react/overview)
  - Channels with [link and open tracking](/send-notifications/tracking)
  - Other cases require manual updates via [Message status API](/reference#update-message-status)

API responses include current statuses in `engagement_statuses` field with timestamps for each engagement type.

Available engagement statuses:

### Seen

| Timestamp field | Badge  |
| --------------- | ------ |
| `seen_at`       | `seen` |

Message displayed in recipient's in-app feed. Managed automatically for in-app feed channel only. Distinct from [opened/read status](/send-notifications/message-statuses#2b-marked-as-read--opened-read_at-iso8601-timestamp) as it doesn't require explicit interaction.

### Marked as read / opened

| Timestamp field | Badge  |
| --------------- | ------ |
| `read_at`       | `read` |

Message opened/read by recipient. Automatically managed for:

- **Email**—Requires [open tracking](/send-notifications/tracking)
- **In-app**—Requires [ReactFeedProvider SDK](/in-app-ui/react/feed)
- **SMS/Chat**—Link clicks count as opens with [link tracking](/send-notifications/tracking)
- **Push/Webhook**—Not supported

### Link clicked

| Timestamp field                   | Badge          |
| --------------------------------- | -------------- |
| `link_clicked_at` or `clicked_at` | `link_clicked` |

Recipient clicked a link in the message. Automatically managed for:

- **Email/SMS/Chat**—Requires [link tracking](/send-notifications/tracking)
- **In-app**—Requires [link tracking](/send-notifications/tracking). Message clicks count if message is a link. "Mark all as read" updates to opened/read status instead
- **Push/Webhook**—Not supported

### Interacted

| Timestamp field | Badge        |
| --------------- | ------------ |
| `interacted_at` | `interacted` |

Recipient clicked notification cell in feed. Only managed for in-app feed channel.

### Archived

| Timestamp field | Badge      |
| --------------- | ---------- |
| `archived_at`   | `archived` |

Message archived by recipient. Only managed for in-app feed channel.

## Message events

Status changes create message events, viewable in chronological order in the message timeline. Events power webhooks—see [outbound webhooks guide](/developer-tools/outbound-webhooks/overview) to integrate with the message lifecycle.
