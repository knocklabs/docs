Sometimes you'll encounter issues with a workflow run that require more visibility into the Knock engine. Knock comes pre-built with a powerful workflow debugger that you can use to understand the state of individual workflow runs.

Using the workflow debugger, you can answer questions such as:

- What messages did this workflow run generate?
- Why did this step not produce any messages?
- Did this recipient have preferences set that opted them out from receiving a notification?
- What prevented this step from executing?

You can see a video of our workflow debugger in action here:

<div style={{ position: "relative", paddingBottom: "56.25%", height: 0 }}>
  <iframe
    src="https://www.loom.com/embed/77c2a99f63914dda83abf6653b4711b8"
    frameBorder="0"
    allowFullScreen
    style={{
      position: "absolute",
      top: 0,
      left: 0,
      width: "100%",
      height: "100%",
    }}
  ></iframe>
</div>

## Accessing the workflow debugger

<Callout

  text={
    <>
      <span className="font-bold">
        Data subject to retention policy enforcement.
      </span>{" "}
      See the{" "}
      <a href="/manage-your-account/data-retention">data retention docs</a> for
      more details on how Knock enforces this policy.
    </>
  }
/>

You can access the workflow debugger from our "Logs" page, which you'll find in the left hand environment sidebar in the dashboard. From there:

1. Find an API log that triggered a workflow run (**hint**: you can use the filters to find only workflow API requests)
2. In the right hand panel, click the "Workflow runs" tab
3. Select a workflow run for any recipient to view the debugger

**Note**: you can also use the debugger to look at test runs as well.
