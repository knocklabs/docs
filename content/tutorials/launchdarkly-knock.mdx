## Integration architecture

The LaunchDarkly + Knock integration follows this flow:

1. **LaunchDarkly** defines your experiment parameters (flags, segments, variations) and manages statistical analysis.
2. **Your application** evaluates flags and passes results to Knock via trigger data.
3. **Knock workflows** use branch steps to deliver different messaging experiences based on flag variations.
4. **Knock** captures engagement events (message delivery, opens, clicks) and forwards them to LaunchDarkly.
5. **LaunchDarkly** correlates engagement events with flag variations to measure experiment success and statistical significance.

## LaunchDarkly concepts and setup

### Flags

LaunchDarkly Flags serve as the control mechanism for your messaging experiments. They determine which message variant each user receives.

We'll be using the example flag below in our tutorial. You could also create multi-variant flags to run more complex experiments with different message content, channels, and timing.

Simple A/B test flag:

- Key: `messaging-AB-test`
- Variations: `control`, `treatment`
- Default: `control`

### Segments

LaunchDarkly Segments enable you to define test populations and ensure consistent user experiences across multiple flags.

```markdown title='Example LaunchDarkly user segments'
premium-users: user.tier == "premium"
free-users: user.tier == "free"
trial-users: user.tier == "trial"
```

### Experiments

LaunchDarkly experiments connect your messaging flags to business metrics, enabling you to measure the effectiveness of different messaging strategies.

```markdown title='Example LaunchDarkly experiment'
Experiment: "Welcome Email Optimization"
Flag: messaging-AB-test
Metric: signup_completion_rate
Allocation: 50% control, 50% treatment
Duration: 2 weeks
Sample size: 10,000 users
```

## Using LaunchDarkly with Knock workflows

You can use LaunchDarkly with Knock workflows to orchestrate different cross-channel messaging experiences based on the flags and experiments you've defined in LaunchDarkly. We'll cover two methods for using LaunchDarkly with Knock workflows: flag-controlled workflow selection and branch-based message variants.

### Method 1: Flag-controlled workflow selection

This approach uses LaunchDarkly flags to determine which Knock workflow to trigger, enabling you to test different notification strategies. You can use this approach to test different messaging approaches, compare email vs. SMS vs. push notification strategies, or test different workflow timing and sequences.

<Steps>
<Step title="Evaluate flag in your application">
First, evaluate the LaunchDarkly flag in your application.

```javascript title="LaunchDarkly flag evaluation"
const messagingVariant = await ldClient.variation(
  "messaging-AB-test",
  user,
  "control",
);
```

</Step>
<Step title="Trigger appropriate workflow">
Next, trigger the appropriate Knock workflow based on the flag value.

```javascript title="Trigger Knock workflow"
const workflowKey =
  messagingVariant === "treatment"
    ? "messaging-AB-test-treatment"
    : "messaging-AB-test-control";

await knock.workflows.trigger(workflowKey, {
  recipients: [user.id],
  data: {
    // Add any data you want to pass to the workflow
  },
});
```

</Step>
</Steps>

### Method 2: Branch-based message variants

This approach uses a single workflow with branch steps to deliver different messaging experiences based on LaunchDarkly data passed via trigger data. You can use this approach to A/B test different templates within the same workflow, personalize message content based on user segments, or run other kinds of flag-based experiments.

<Steps>
<Step title="Evaluate flags and pass to Knock">

First, evaluate the LaunchDarkly flags in your application and pass the results to Knock via trigger data.

```javascript title="Evaluate multiple flags and pass to Knock"
const variation = await ldClient.variation(
  "messaging-AB-test",
  user,
  "control",
);

await knock.workflows.trigger("onboarding-sequence", {
  recipients: [user.id],
  data: {
    user_ab_test_variation: variation,
    // Any other data you want to pass to the workflow
  },
});
```

</Step>
<Step title="Configure branch step in Knock workflow">

In your Knock workflow, add a branch step with these conditions:

- **Control branch**: `data.user_ab_test_variation == "control"`
- **Treatment branch**: `data.user_ab_test_variation == "treatment"`
- **Default branch**: Fallback for any unmatched conditions

</Step>
</Steps>

## Analytics and analyzing results

To measure messaging experiment success, forward Knock's engagement events to LaunchDarkly. This allows LaunchDarkly to correlate message engagement with flag variations and calculate proper conversion rates.

Three integration approaches are available:

1. **Direct webhook integration.** Forward events in real-time via Knock's [outbound webhooks](/developer-tools/outbound-webhooks/overview).
2. **Segment integration.** Use Knock's [Segment extension](/integrations/extensions/segment) to route events through Segment to LaunchDarkly.
3. **Data warehouse integration.** Use Knock's [warehouse sync](/integrations/extensions/data-sync) to bring data into your warehouse for analysis.

### Method 1: Direct webhook integration

Set up a webhook endpoint to receive Knock events and forward them to LaunchDarkly.

<Steps>
<Step title="Create webhook endpoint">

Create an endpoint to receive Knock webhook events and forward them to LaunchDarkly:

```javascript title="Webhook endpoint to forward events to LaunchDarkly"
app.post("/knock-webhook", async (req, res) => {
  const { type, data } = req.body;

  // Forward engagement events to LaunchDarkly
  if (type === "message.read" || type === "message.link_clicked") {
    await ldClient.track({
      eventName: type === "message.read" ? "email_opened" : "email_clicked",
      user: { key: data.recipient.id },
      data: {
        message_id: data.id,
        workflow_key: data.workflow.key,
        channel: data.channel_id,
      },
    });
  }

  res.status(200).send("OK");
});
```

</Step>
<Step title="Configure webhook in Knock">

In your Knock dashboard:

1. Go to Developer â†’ Webhooks
2. Add your webhook endpoint URL
3. Select events: `message.read`, `message.link_clicked`, `message.delivered`
4. Enable webhook

</Step>
</Steps>

### Method 2: Segment integration

Use Knock's [Segment extension](/integrations/extensions/segment) to automatically forward events through Segment to LaunchDarkly.

<Steps>
<Step title="Configure Segment extension">

Configure the Segment extension in your Knock dashboard with your Segment write key. Knock will automatically forward engagement events to Segment.

</Step>
<Step title="Set up Segment to LaunchDarkly connection">

In your Segment dashboard:

1. Add LaunchDarkly as a destination.
2. Configure event mapping from Knock events to LaunchDarkly metrics.
3. Map events like `Notification read` â†’ `email_opened` in LaunchDarkly.

</Step>
</Steps>

### Method 3: Data warehouse integration

For comprehensive analytics, combine Knock's [data warehouse sync](/integrations/extensions/data-sync) with LaunchDarkly's data export.

<Steps>
<Step title="Enable Knock warehouse sync">

Configure warehouse sync to your data warehouse. This provides detailed message and engagement data.

</Step>
<Step title="Export LaunchDarkly experiment data">

Use LaunchDarkly's data export to get flag variation data in your warehouse, then join with Knock's engagement data for analysis.

</Step>
</Steps>

## Implementation example: welcome email A/B test

This example shows a complete implementation of A/B testing welcome emails with different messaging styles.

<Steps>
<Step title="LaunchDarkly setup">

First, create the flag and experiment in LaunchDarkly.

**Create flag in LaunchDarkly:**

```json title="Create flag in LaunchDarkly"
{
  "key": "welcome-email-style",
  "name": "Welcome Email Style Test",
  "variations": [
    { "value": "friendly", "name": "Friendly" },
    { "value": "professional", "name": "Professional" },
    { "value": "casual", "name": "Casual" }
  ],
  "defaultVariation": "friendly"
}
```

**Set up experiment:**

```json title="Set up experiment in LaunchDarkly"
{
  "name": "Welcome Email Optimization",
  "flagKey": "welcome-email-style",
  "primaryMetric": "email_opened",
  "allocation": {
    "friendly": 34,
    "professional": 33,
    "casual": 33
  }
}
```

**Create metrics for the experiment:**

```json title="Create metrics in LaunchDarkly"
{
  "email_opened": {
    "eventName": "email_opened",
    "unitOfMeasurement": "conversion",
    "description": "Measures email open rate of users who received the message"
  },
  "email_clicked": {
    "eventName": "email_clicked",
    "unitOfMeasurement": "conversion",
    "description": "Measures click-through rate of users who received the message"
  }
}
```

</Step>
<Step title="Application integration">

Integrate the LaunchDarkly flag evaluation into your user registration flow.

```javascript title="User registration flow with LaunchDarkly integration"
// In your user registration flow
async function sendWelcomeEmail(user) {
  // Evaluate LaunchDarkly flag
  const emailStyle = await ldClient.variation(
    "welcome-email-style",
    user,
    "friendly",
  );

  // Trigger Knock workflow
  await knock.workflows.trigger("welcome-sequence", {
    recipients: [user.id],
    data: {
      email_style: emailStyle,
      experiment_name: "welcome-email-optimization",
    },
  });
}
```

</Step>
<Step title="Knock workflow configuration">

Create a workflow with branch steps and configure email templates for each variant.

**Create workflow with branch step:**

- Workflow key: `welcome-sequence`
- Add branch step with conditions:
  - **Friendly branch**: `data.email_style == "friendly"`
  - **Professional branch**: `data.email_style == "professional"`
  - **Casual branch**: `data.email_style == "casual"`

Configure email templates for each variant.

</Step>
<Step title="Tracking and analytics">

Set up conversion tracking and monitor experiment results.

**Set up conversion tracking:**

```javascript title="Conversion tracking setup"
// Track when users complete onboarding
app.post("/onboarding-complete", async (req, res) => {
  const { user_id, style } = req.body;

  // Track conversion in LaunchDarkly
  await ldClient.track("onboarding-completion", {
    user: { key: user_id },
    data: {
      experiment_name: "welcome-email-optimization",
      variant: style,
      conversion_value: 1,
    },
  });

  res.status(200).send("OK");
});
```

</Step>
</Steps>
