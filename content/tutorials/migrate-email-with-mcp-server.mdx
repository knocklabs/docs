Storing your email templates in Knock comes with [many advantages](/designing-workflows/template-editor/overview#frequently-asked-questions), but planning and executing a migration can require a lot of time and effort, especially if your current email templates exist in multiple languages or systems.

In this guide, we'll walk you through how to leverage Knock's [MCP server](/developer-tools/mcp-server) with the LLM of your choice as a low-effort solution to quickly migrate your email templates to Knock.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, you'll need access to the following:

- A [Knock account](https://dashboard.knock.app/).
- A configured [email provider](/integrations/email/overview) in your Knock account. Navigate to **Integrations** > **Channels** in your dashboard to set this up if you haven't already done so.
- A [service token](https://docs.knock.app/developer-tools/service-tokens) for your Knock account.
- An MCP-compatible client (such as Cursor or Claude Desktop). We recommend Cursor for working with a large collection of HTML files.
- Your existing email template files. Your templates will be upserted to Knock as HTML, so if you're using a format like MJML or React Email you may want to consider converting them to HTML before you begin.

For more information on setting up the Knock MCP server, see the [Get started](/developer-tools/mcp-server#get-started) section of the MCP documentation.

### Required MCP tools

When working with MCP servers, it's recommended that you expose only the tools you need for your use case to your LLM. The steps in this guide will require access to the following tools:

- `documentation.*`
- `channels.*`
- `commits.*`
- `emailLayouts.*`
- `partials.*`
- `workflows.*`

Learn more about configuring these tools in your MCP-compatible client [here](/developer-tools/mcp-server#configuring-the-available-tools). If you're using Cursor, you can simply copy and paste the configuration below into your MCP settings.

## Background

## Migration steps

Now that you have everything you need for your migration, you're ready to get started!

Each step below contains a prompt that you can provide to your LLM. These prompts are designed to be run one at a time in order to provide the LLM with discrete tasks, thus improving the accuracy of the results.
