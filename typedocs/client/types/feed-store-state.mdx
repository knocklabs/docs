A **[zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) state store** that holds the current feed state, including item counts, for easy notification feed rendering within your application. The FeedStoreState is entirely managed by the `Feed` instance, and any calls to `fetch()`, `markAsX`, or `fetchNextPage` will update the state accordingly.
