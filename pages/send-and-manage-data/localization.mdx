## An overview

You can localize your message templates referencing translation files you create in Knock with the Liquid `t` filter in your message templates. This is useful when you want to send the same notification in different languages, based on your recipient’s locale.
This keeps your notifications streamlined - rather than using conditionals within
the template, you can reference the text that will be translated right from the template
itself.

## Enabling translations and setting a default locale

First you’ll have to enable translations for your account and set a default locale. This will be the “fallback” locale - if a translation for a given recipient’s locale is missing, it will look for the translation in this default locale instead.

Go to “Settings” under your account name in the left sidebar and click “Enable translations” to select your locale. (You can always change this default language later.) Now, you should see a new “Translations” link under “Developers” in the sidebar. This is where you’ll be working with your translation files.

## Basic usage

Translations are a JSON object that contain the text for your messages in various locales. For example, let’s say you have a customer order notification you’re building and want to localize it for French and English users. Your translation files might look like this:

```json en translation
{
  "OrderReady": "Your order is ready.",
  "OrderDelayed": "Your order is delayed."
}
```

```json fr translation
{
  "OrderReady": "Votre commande est prête.",
  "OrderDelayed": "Votre commande est retardée."
}
```

Once you have those translations created for the `en` and `fr` locales, you can reference it in your message template like this:

```json Message template editor
<p> {{ "OrderReady" | t }} </p>
```

The recipient must have a `“locale”` property set to receive the translation with the same locale. You can add properties to any of your users when you call the [user identify endpoint](/reference#identify-user). For a recipient with a locale of `en`, they would see “Your order is ready” while a recipient with a locale of `fr` would see “Votre commande est prête”. If a recipient doesn't have their locale set, because our fallback locale is `en` they would also see "Your order is ready."

## Working with translation files

Translation files are git controlled, so like workflows you’ll be able to commit them to the environment where you want to use them. You can see all of your translations in the translations page.

### Creating a translation file

In the translations page, click “Create translation” on the top right to make a new translation file. You’ll select the locale for the file and you’ll be able to supply an optional “namespace”. The namespace helps organize files of the same locale so you can keep similar concepts together. You can see how to reference namespaced files in your message templates [here](/send-and-manage-data/localization#namespaced-translation-files).

Keep in mind that you cannot create two translations with the same locale and namespace and you cannot edit a namespace - this helps preserve the references used within your message templates.

### Editing a translation file

Once you’ve created a translation file, you can begin to add to it and edit the JSON directly. Make sure to “Save” it when you’re happy with it, and then you can click “Commit” to make it available in your development environment. You must use valid JSON, but there are no restrictions on the format of the keys or on how deeply nested you decide to build your translation.

  }

### Archiving a translation

From the list of translations, click the 3-dot menu next to the translation you want to archive and the option will appear if your role has the permissions to manage translations.

## Using the `t` filter in your message templates

Knock supplies a `t` filter for you to reference your translation files from within the message template. As shown [above](send-and-manage-data/localization#basic-usage), you’ll reference the key of the translation you want to use followed by `| t` and it will supply the translation for the recipient’s locale. The `t` filter also allows you to use variables, other filters, and special pluralization rules as well, which we’ll cover here.

### Namespaced translation files

You’ll use namespaced translation files just as you would a translation file without a namespace, but you’ll use a special way to access it in the message template. Make sure you have the same namespace across your locales if you use them so that the message template will be able to access all of the content in them. Here’s an example of using a namespaced file in message template.

For a translation file with a namespace of `shipping`:

```json en:shipping translation
{
  "backordered": "Your order has been backordered so shipping will be delayed.",
  "shipped": "Your order has been shipped.",
  "canceled": "Your shipment has been canceled."
}
```

To access the contents of the `shipping` file in your message template you’ll reference the namespace before the key followed by a colon (”:”):

```json Message template editor
<p> {{ "shipping:canceled" | t }} </p>
```

This can be helpful if you use the `canceled` key else where in your translations so that there isn’t a collision. For example, if you had a `payments` file like this:

```json en:payments translation
{
  "success": "Your payment has been processed.",
  "canceled": "Your payment was canceled."
}
```

You would reference it with the `payments` namespace as well:

```json Message template editor
<p> {{ "payments:canceled" | t }} </p>
```

And if you had a translation file that wasn’t namespaced, say the `en` translation file, you would simply use the key alone. All together in a template, it would look like this:

```json Message template editor
<p> Hello, </p>
<p> {{ "payments:canceled" | t }} </p>
<p> {{ "shipments:canceled" | t }} </p>
<p> {{ "canceled" | t }} </p>
```

### Nested translation files

You can create whatever JSON structure you need to hold your translations, sometimes those might be deeply nested. Given the following translation:

```json en translation
{
  "customers": {
    "orders": {
      "beenReceived": "Have you received your order?",
      "survey": "How was your order?"
    },
    "reminder": {
      "paymentInfo": "Remember to update your payment information!"
    }
  }
}
```

You can access the content with dot-syntax like this:

```json Message template editor
<p> {{ "customers.orders.beenReceived" | t }} </p>
```

The same goes for namespaced files. If the above translation was in a file named `services` , you would do the following:

```json Message template editor
<p> {{ "services:customers.orders.beenReceived" | t }} </p>
```

### Variables and interpolation

You can and probably will often use variables inside of your translations. Let’s look at this translation file example:

```json en translation
{
  "comment": "New comment from {{ actorName }} on your post {{ postName }}.",
  "like": "{{ actorName }} liked your photo {{ photoTitle}}!"
}
```

You can pass variables to the filter like this:

```json Message template editor
<p> {{ "like" | t: actorName: actor.name, photoTitle: likedPhoto.title }} </p>
```

Where “actor” and “likedPhoto” are variables that get passed into your data payload and have a name and title key, respectively.

### Pluralization

Translations sometimes need specialized pluralization rules. When you pass the `count` variable to a translation, it will know to look for a special set of keys within your translation file to match it to. Those keys are `zero`, `one`, and `other`. You don’t need to reference these in the template, if you pass the `count` variable it will evaluate it and choose one for you.

For example:

```json en translation
{
  "orders": {
    "shipping": {
      "zero": "You have no orders currently being shipped.",
      "one": "You have one order being shipped.",
      "other": "You have {{ count }} orders being shipped."
    }
  }
}
```

And you would just need to pass your `count` variable for it to choose one of these based on the number:

```json Message template editor
<p> {{ "orders.shipping" | t: count: count }} </p>
```

- If the count is 0, it will choose `zero`, unless `zero` does not exist and then it will use `other`.
- 1 corresponds to `one`, and everything else will fall under `others`.

### Other filters in combination

You can still use other filters in combination with `t` but you’ll use them **\***after**\*** you use the `t` filter. For example, to titlecase a translation:

```json Message template editor
<p> {{ "congratulationsMessage" | t | titlecase }} </p>
```

## Rules for determining the translation used for a recipient

Locales have three levels of fallbacks:

1. Language + region
2. Language
3. Default locale (language OR language + region)

The message template will first try to find a translation that corresponds with a recipients specific language + region, like `fr-BE` for French-Belgian . If it doesn’t find one, it will fall back on looking for a translation for `fr`, since that’s the language code for the locale. And if it still can’t find that, it will fall back on the default locale, in the case of this example `en`.
