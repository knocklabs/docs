Subscriptions are an extension to [Objects](/send-and-manage-data/objects) and express the relationship between a [Recipient](/send-and-manage-data/recipients) (the subscriber) and an Object.

You can use subscriptions for:

- Creating notifications for a large number of recipients (e.g. all users of your product)
- Alerting use cases, where users can opt into and out of an alert
- Publish/subscribe models where you want to fan out to a set of users subscribed to a topic

Any Object within Knock can be subscribed to by one or more recipients, and the entire set of subscribers can be notified by triggering a workflow for the object, without you needing to keep the relationship data within your system of who is subscribed to what.

## How subscriptions work

1. Identify an object in a collection that represents the topic, or entity you wish to subscribe recipients to
2. Subscribe one or more recipients to the object by creating a subscription between the recipient and the object
3. Trigger a workflow for the object

On step #3, Knock will handle the fan out of the workflow trigger **to all recipients that are subscribers**, automatically enqueuing a workflow run for the recipient on your behalf.

## Integrating subscriptions

Note: for all of the examples below you will need to have an [object identified within Knock](/send-and-manage-data/objects#1-set-individual-objects). In our examples below, we create an object under a `project_alerts` collection with an id `project-1`.

[Go to API documentation â†’](/reference#subscriptions)

### Subscribing recipients to an object

Subscribing a recipient to an object creates an `ObjectSubscription` entity describing the relationship between the `Recipient` and the `Object`.

You can subscribe up to 100 recipients to an object at a time by passing one or more `RecipientIdentifiers`. There is no limit to the number of recipients you can subscribe to an object.

```javascript Subscribing multiple recipients to an object
await knock.objects.addSubscriptions("project_alerts", "project-1", {
  recipients: ["esattler", "dnedry"],
  properties: {
    // Optionally set other properties on the subscription for each recipient
  },
});
```

Similar to workflow triggers, you can inline identify recipients while subscribing them to an object.

```javascript Identifying users while subscribing them to an object
await knock.objects.addSubscriptions("project_alerts", "project-1", {
  recipients: [
    {
      id: "esattler",
      name: "Ellie Sattler",
      email: "esattler@ingen.net",
    },
    {
      id: "dnedry",
      name: "Dennis Nedry",
      email: "dnedry@ingen.net",
    },
  ],
  properties: {
    // Optionally set other properties on the subscription for each recipient
  },
});
```

### Unsubscribing recipients from an object

To remove one or more recipients (up to 100) from an object, you can pass a list of recipient identifiers.

```javascript Triggering a workflow for all subscribers of an object
await knock.objects.removeSubscriptions("project_alerts", "project-1", {
  recipients: ["esattler", "dnedry"],
});
```

### Triggering a workflow for all subscribers of an object

By default when you trigger a workflow for an object that has subscriptions attached Knock will fan out to all subscribers and enqueue a new workflow run for that recipient, with the information passed into the workflow trigger.

```javascript Triggering a workflow for all subscribers of an object
await knock.workflows.trigger("alert-workflow", {
  recipients: [{ collection: "project_alerts", id: "project-1" }],
  data: {
    // Data to be passed to all workflow runs
  },
});
```

### Retrieving subscriptions for an object

You can retrieve a paginated list of subscriptions for an object, which will return the `recipient` subscribed as well.

```javascript Retrieving a paginated list of subscriptions for an object
const { entries, page_info: pageInfo } = await knock.objects.listSubscriptions(
  "project_alerts",
  "project-1",
  { after: null },
);
```

### Retrieving subscriptions for a user

You can retrieve a paginated list of active subscriptions for a user, which will return the `object` that the user is subscribed to as well.

```javascript Retrieving a paginated list of subscriptions for a user
const { entries, page_info: pageInfo } = await knock.users.getSubscriptions(
  "user-1",
  { after: null },
);
```

## Accessing subscription properties in a workflow run

When triggering a workflow for a recipient from a subscription, the `properties` defined on the subscription are made available for use within the workflow run scope. You can access the properties under the `recipient.subscription` namespace.

As an example, if you have a property `role` under your subscription properties, you can access it as `recipient.subscription.role` in the workflow run scope.

## Frequently asked questions

#### What's the maximum number of subscribers I can have against an object?

There's no upper bound in the number of subscribers you can have against a recipient, although you can only **manage** 100 recipients on an object at a time using our API.

#### Can I have nested relationships for my objects?

Yes! An object with subscribers _can also_ be subscribed to a parent object, allowing you to create nested hierarchies of objects (like a Team has many Projects, and each Project has many Members).

#### Can I manage subscribers to an object in the dashboard?

Right now, you can only **view** the subscribers of an object in the dashboard. You can do so under "Objects > Subscriptions".

#### Can I set custom properties on a Subscription?

Yes, you can pass a set of `properties`, which is a set of unstructured key-value pairs that you set any arbitrary data about.

#### Can I filter the set of Subscriptions to be notified?

Right now the answer is no, but we're interested in hearing about your use case here as we're considering adding this functionality in the future.

#### Can I still debug workflow runs for the subscribers of an object?

Yes, you can. Once you trigger a workflow for an object that has subscribers attached, you will see a workflow run for each of the subscribers under the "Workflow runs" page.

#### Can I notify both the object AND the subscribers of the object?

Yes, by default when you trigger a workflow for an object that has subscriptions attached Knock will generate a workflow run for the object itself AND all of the attached subscribers.

### Is the object that recipients are subscribed to exposed in the workflow run scope?

No, currently we do not expose the object the subscription belongs to under the workflow run scope.
