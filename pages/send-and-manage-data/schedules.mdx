A schedule allows you to automatically trigger a workflow at a given time for one or more recipients. You can think of a schedule as a managed, recipient-timezone-aware cron job that Knock will run on your behalf.

An example of where you might reach for a schedule: a digest notification where your users can select the frequency in which they wish to receive the digest (every day, every week, every month).

## How schedules work

1. [Create a workflow](/designing-workflows) that you wish to run repeatedly.
2. Using the API, [set a repeating schedule](#scheduling-workflows-for-recipients) for one or more recipients for the workflow.

Knock will preemptively schedule workflow runs for the recipient(s) that you've provided, and execute those runs at the scheduled time. At the end of the workflow run, a future scheduled workflow will be enqueued based on the recipient's next schedule.

## Scheduling workflows for recipients

To schedule a workflow for a recipient, you must first have a valid, committed workflow in your environment. We can then set a schedule for one or more recipients (up to 100 at a time).

```typescript
const { Knock } = require("@knocklabs/node");
const knock = new Knock(process.env.KNOCK_API_KEY);

const schedules = await knock.workflows.createSchedules("park-alert", {
  recipients: ["jhammond", "esattler", "dnedry"],
  data: { type: "dinosaurs-loose" },
  tenant: "jpark",
});
```

Scheduling a workflow accepts:

| Variable       | Type                  | Description                                                               |
| -------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `recipients`   | RecipientIdentifier[] | One or more recipient identifiers, or complete recipients to be upserted. |
| `workflow`     | string                | The workflow to trigger                                                   |
| `repeats`      | ScheduleRepeat[]      | A list of one or more repeats (see below)                                 |
| `data`         | map                   | Custom data to pass to every workflow trigger                             |
| `tenant`       | string                | A tenant to pass to the workflow trigger                                  |
| `actor`        | RecipientIdentifier   | An identifier of an actor, or a complete actor to be upserted             |
| `scheduled_at` | utc_datetime          | A UTC datetime to start the schedule from                                 |

## Modeling repeat behavior

Every schedule accepts one or more repeat rules, which allow you to express complex rules like:

- Every Monday at 9am.
- Every weekday at 10.30am.
- Every other Monday, Tuesday, and Friday at 6pm.
- Every year at midnight.

A schedule repeat has the following type structure:

```typescript
enum DaysOfWeek {
  Mon = "mon",
  Tue = "tue",
  Wed = "wed",
  Thu = "thu",
  Fri = "fri",
  Sat = "sat",
  Sun = "sun",
}

enum RepeatFrequency {
  Monthly = "monthly",
  Weekly = "weekly",
  Daily = "daily",
  Hourly = "hourly",
}

type ScheduleRepeatProperties = {
  frequency: RepeatFrequency;
  interval?: number;
  day_of_month?: number;
  days?: DaysOfWeek[] | "weekdays" | "weekends";
  hours?: number;
  minutes?: number;
};
```

## Updating schedules

Up to 100 recipient schedules can be updated in a single call. Keep in mind that the properties passed in will be applied to all schedules.

```typescript Updating schedules
const { Knock } = require("@knocklabs/node");
const knock = new Knock(process.env.KNOCK_API_KEY);

const schedules = await knock.workflows.updateSchedules({
  schedule_ids: workflowScheduleIds,
  data: { foo: "bar" },
});
```

## Removing schedules

Up to 100 schedules can be deleted at a time, causing any already enqueued schedules to be cancelled for a recipient.

```typescript Removing schedules
const { Knock } = require("@knocklabs/node");
const knock = new Knock(process.env.KNOCK_API_KEY);

const schedules = await knock.workflows.deleteSchedules({
  schedule_ids: workflowScheduleIds,
});
```

## Listing scheduled workflows

Schedules can be listed per recipient (for a user or an object), or for an individual workflow:

```typescript Listing schedules for a user
const { Knock } = require("@knocklabs/node");
const knock = new Knock(process.env.KNOCK_API_KEY);

const { entries: schedules } = await knock.users.getSchedules("sam");
```

<br />

```typescript Listing schedules for a specific workflow
const { Knock } = require("@knocklabs/node");
const knock = new Knock(process.env.KNOCK_API_KEY);

const { entries: schedules } = await knock.workflows.listSchedules(
  "workflow-key",
);
```

Schedules include a `next_occurrence_at` property which computes the **next time that a schedule will be executed**.

## Workflow data in a scheduled workflow run

Workflows in Knock are triggered either via an API call or via a Source event, both of which will pass the `data` associated. In the case of a scheduled workflow, the workflow will be triggered with an empty data payload by default.

There are 2 ways in which to get data into each of your scheduled workflow runs:

1. **Define static data passed to every triggered workflow on a schedule.** We can include an optional `data` payload when we create our schedule. Any workflow runs triggered by that schedule will include the data payload within their workflow run scope.
2. **Fetch data from an HTTP endpoint to use in your workflow.** You can use an [fetch function step](/designing-workflows/fetch-function) to fetch data for a triggered scheduled workflow to ‚Äúenrich‚Äù the data available with information from a remote server (via HTTP).

## Executing schedules in a recipient's timezone

Knock supports a `timezone` property on the recipient that automatically makes a scheduled workflow run timezone aware, meaning you can express recurring schedules like "every monday at 9am in the recipient's timezone". Recipient timezones must be a [valid tz database time zone string](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones), like `America/New_York`.

[Read more about recipient timezone support](/send-and-manage-data/recipients#recipient-timezones).

## Frequently asked questions

**How can I start my repeating schedule at a particular time?**
You can use the `scheduled_at` attribute to start your schedule at a particular time in the future.

**How can my scheduled workflows use dynamic template data?**
You can use an HTTP fetch step to fetch data in your workflow as the first step to execute to fetch dynamic template data used in your workflow.

**How can I set static data per workflow schedule?**
When scheduling a workflow for one or more recipients, you can optionally provide a static set of `data` which will be passed to the invoked workflow.

**Can I cancel a scheduled workflow?**
At any point before the scheduled workflow is invoked you can unschedule the workflow for one or more recipients. If a workflow has already run, then [normal workflow cancellation rules](/send-notifications/canceling-workflows) take effect.

**Can I still debug a scheduled workflow?**
You‚Äôll see workflow runs that initiated from a scheduled workflow in the list of workflow runs. From there you can select the debugger and debug a given workflow.

**Can I model exclusion rules in my repeat logic?**
Currently, no but we'll be looking to add this feature in the near future.
