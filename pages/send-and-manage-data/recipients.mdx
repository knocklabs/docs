A Recipient within Knock is any [User](/send-and-manage-data/users) or [Object](/send-and-manage-data/objects) that may wish to receive notifications. Knock persists information about recipients to send those recipients notifications and give a single source of truth for the notifications sent for debugging and logging purposes.

Recipients have:

- **Identifiers.** A string from your system that uniquely represents the recipient.
- **Properties.** Structured and unstructured data for the recipient, including but not limited to the name, email, and phone number.
- **Preferences.** The rules under which the recipient should or should not receive notifications.
- **Channel data.** Channel data send a recipient a notification on a particular channel, such as tokens for sending push notifications to a given channel or access tokens to send notifications to a chat channel like Slack.

## `RecipientIdentifier` definiton

A recipient identifier can be one of:

- A string user ID for a previously identified user (`user-1`)
- An object reference dictionary (`{ "collection": "my-collection", "id": "object-1" }`) for a previously identified object
- A dictionary containing a recipient to be [identified inline](#inline-identifying-recipients)

This can be expressed as the following type:

```typescript
type RecipientIdentifier =
  | string
  | { collection: string; id: string }
  | Record<string, any>;
```

## Ahead-of-time identifying recipients

Recipients should be `identified` to Knock so that Knock can execute workflows for those recipients. You can see more in the documentation for both users and objects on how to individually and bulk identify.

- [Identifying users](/send-and-manage-data/users#1-individual-identification)
- [Identifying objects](/send-and-manage-data/objects#1-set-individual-objects)

## Inline identifying recipients

A recipient can be passed **inline** when triggering a workflow or when subscribing a recipient to an object.

An inline identify causes to Knock to create/update the recipient before completing the action in which the inline identify is taking place (e.g. the workflow trigger).

```json An example list of recipients to be identified inline
{
  "recipients": [
    {
      "id": "esattler",
      "name": "Ellie Sattler",
      "email": "esattler@ingen.net"
    },
    {
      "id": "dnedry",
      "name": "Dennis Nedry",
      "email": "dnedry@ingen.net"
    }
  ]
}
```

In the example above, when this set of recipients are passed to Knock we first upsert the two users, creating or replacing the properties sent.

### Setting preferences inline

When inline identifying a recipient, one or more [preference sets](/send-and-manage-data/preferences) can also be supplied for the recipient, upserting any existing preferences set for the recipient.

```json An example of inline identifying a recipient with a preference set
{
  "recipients": [
    {
      "id": "esattler",
      "name": "Ellie Sattler",
      "email": "esattler@ingen.net",
      "preferences": {
        "default": {
          "channel_types": {
            "email": false
          }
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Note**: the preference set `id` must always be supplied in the dictionary of preferences sent, which in the example above is `default`.

### Setting channel data inline

Along with preferences, [channel data](/send-notifications/setting-channel-daa) can also be specified inline along with a `RecipientIdentifier`, replacing any existing channel data set for the channels given.

```json An example of inline identifying a recipient with channel data
{
  "recipients": [
    {
      "id": "esattler",
      "name": "Ellie Sattler",
      "email": "esattler@ingen.net",
      "channel_data": {
        "4672d685-c586-4ec6-ad88-52185262af97": {
          "tokens": ["apns-push-token"]
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Note**: the key in the channel data dictionary is the channel ID of a valid channel you've created within Knock. You can find a channel's ID on its channel page ("Integrations" > "Channels").

## Managing lists of recipients

You can use our [Subscriptions](/send-and-manage-data/subscriptions) feature to create a Knock-managed list of recipients that should be notified. Subscriptions are useful for modeling pub/sub behavior.

## Recipient timezones

A recipient can have an optional `timezone` property, which should be a [valid tz database time zone string](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones), like `America/New_York` or `Europe/London`. By default, if no recipient timezone is set `Etc/UTC` will be used however a default timezone can be specified at the account level under "Settings" which will override this default for all recipients.

## Frequently asked questions

#### Is there a limit on the number of recipients I can have in Knock?

No, there's no limit on the number of recipients you can have within Knock.

#### Why would I need a non-user recipient?

We support non-user entities (Objects) receiving notifications in Knock because some notifications are delivered to non-user entities. For example, a Slack notification that sends to a channel. That notification is not delivered to a user but to an entity that connects Slack and your system (such as a Project or a Team).

#### Is there a limit to the size of the properties I can pass on a recipient to Knock?

Currently, there's no limit to the size of the properties you can add to a recipient. We reserve the right to impose a limit here in the future, however.
