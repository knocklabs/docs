In this guide we'll look at how to support multi-tenancy within your Knock-powered notifications.

## An overview of multi-tenancy

Multi-tenancy is the concept in which your users belong to one or more "tenants", which you may call "accounts", "organizations", "workspaces", or similar. This is a common pattern in many SaaS applications, where users will have a single login joined to multiple tenants to represent their membership within each.

## Multi-tenancy within notifications

Multi-tenancy is important in your notification system when handling in-app feeds. Lets look at an example.
Imagine that we have a SaaS application, Collaborato, where our users belong to one or more different
workspaces. When one of our users is active in a current workspace, we want to make sure they only
see notifications that are relevant for that workspace. That is, a user in the "Acme Fish Co." workspace
should only see notifications that are relevant to "Acme Fish Co.".

To support this use case within Knock, we can pass a `tenant` identifier into our notify calls:

<MultiLangCodeBlock
  snippet="workflows.trigger-with-tenant"
  title="Notify with tenant"
/>

When retrieving our feed to be displayed, we can then scope the feed to only show items relevant
to the tenant:

```jsx Client-side feed scoping
// If you're using our `client-js` SDK:
import Knock from "@knocklabs/client";
const knockClient = new Knock(process.env.KNOCK_PUBLIC_API_KEY);

const feedClient = knockClient.feeds.initialize(process.env.KNOCK_FEED_ID, {
  // Scope all requests to the current workspace
  tenant: currentWorkspace.id,
});

// Or if you're using the React SDK:
<KnockFeedProvider
  apiKey={process.env.KNOCK_PUBLIC_API_KEY}
  feedId={process.env.KNOCK_FEED_ID}
  userId={currentUser.id}
  tenant={currentWorkspace.id}
>
  ...
</KnockFeedProvider>;
```

By providing the `tenant` property here, we're letting Knock know that the notifications produced
in the `notify` call belong to a particular tenant and that when we're showing the feed to our customers we **only** want to see the feed that's related to that tenant.

Under the hood Knock will ensure that the badge counts you receive for the feed will be relevant
only to the active workspace, and that no real-time notifications will be received for any messages
that aren't relevant to the user.

## Different preferences per tenant

Another advanced (and somewhat uncommon) tenancy use case is managing different sets of preferences
for each user-tenant pair. That is, a user may have different preferences configured for "Acme Fish Co."
than they do for "Bell's Bagels", two hypothetical workspaces within our example collaboration app,
Collaborato.
