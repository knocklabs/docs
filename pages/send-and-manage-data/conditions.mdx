Knock uses conditions to model checks that determine variations in your [workflow](/designing-workflows) runs. They provide a powerful way to create more advanced notification logic flows.

You can use conditions in three areas of the Knock model:

1. [**Step conditions**](/designing-workflows/step-conditions) â€” Used to determine if a single step in one of your workflows should execute during each workflow run. For example, only send an email if the preceding in-app notification has not yet been read or seen.
2. [**Channel conditions**](/integrations/overview#channel-conditions) â€” Used to determine if any step using the given channel should execute across all workflow runs. For example, only execute your Postmark email channel steps in your production environment.
3. [**Preference conditions**](/send-and-manage-data/preferences#preference-conditions) â€” Used to determine the complete set of preferences available to the current workflow run. For example, allow a recipient to mute notifications for specific resources in your product.

Each of these three cases share the same underlying data model and UI editor, which we outline in detail here.

## Condition types

Knock's shared conditions model supports the following types of conditions:

- **Data** â€” Evaluates against a property in the [workflow trigger](/send-notifications/triggering-workflows) data payload.
- **Recipient** â€” Evaluates against a property on the workflow run [recipient](/send-and-manage-data/recipients).
- **Actor** â€” Evaluates against a property on the workflow run [actor](/send-notifications/triggering-workflows#attributing-the-action-to-a-user-or-object).
- **Environment variable** â€” Evaluates against one of your [environment variables](/send-and-manage-data/environments#account-and-environment-variables).
- **Workflow** â€” Evaluates against a property of the currently executing workflow.
- **Workflow run state** â€” Evaluates against a property of the current workflow run.
- **Tenant** â€” Evaluates against a property on the [tenant](/send-and-manage-data/tenants) associated with the current workflow run.
- **Message status** â€” Evaluates against the [delivery status](/send-notifications/message-statuses#delivery-status) or [engagement status](/send-notifications/message-statuses#engagement-status) of a message from a previous step in the current workflow run.

## Modeling conditions

Knock models each condition as a combination of three properties: a `variable`, an `operator`, and an `argument`. This will feel familiar to boolean logic with infix operators in many modern programming languages.

In our JSON representation this will look something like:

```json A workflow run condition
{
  "variable": "run.total_activities",
  "operator": "greater_than",
  "argument": "5"
}
```

We also provide a [conditions editor](#the-conditions-editor) that provides some helpful UX abstractions on top of this model for building conditions in the Knock dashboard.

### Variables

A condition variable is always a string formatted like `"<prefix>.<path>"`. Knock uses the variable `prefix` to determine the condition type and the variable `path` to determine where to look up the data for evaluation.

Knock allows the following variable formats:

| Variable | Description |
| - | - |
| `data.<path>` | A data condition, where `<path>` is used to select a property from the workflow trigger data payload. |
| `recipient.<prop>` | A recipient condition, where `<prop>` is used to select a property on the current recipient. |
| `actor.<prop>` | An actor condition, where `<prop>` is used to select a property on the current actor. |
| `var.<var>` | An environment variable condition, where `<var>` is the name of one of your environment variables. |
| `workflow.{id,name,categories}` | A workflow condition. |
| `run.{total_activities,total_actors}` | A workflow run condition. |
| `tenant.<prop>` | A tenant condition, where `<prop>` is used to select a property on the current tenant. |
| `refs.<ref>.delivery_status` | A [message status condition](/designing-workflows/step-conditions#message-status-conditions) that evaluates against a message's [delivery status](/send-notifications/message-statuses#delivery-status), where `<ref>` identifies the preceding workflow step that generated the message. |
| `refs.<ref>.engagement_status` | A [message status condition](/designing-workflows/step-conditions#message-status-conditions) that evaluates against a message's [engagement status](/send-notifications/message-statuses#engagement-status), where `<ref>` identifies the preceding workflow step that generated the message. |

In cases where data is not found at the path given by the variable, Knock falls back to an empty string as the default value.

### Arguments

Knock uses the condition argument as the expected value in the condition evaluation. Arguments can be either static values or dynamic properties.

#### Static arguments

Static arguments can be any of the following JSON literals:

- Strings (`"foo"`, `"bar"`, `"baz"`)
- Numbers (`1.0`, `2`, `10000`)
- Booleans (`true`, `false`)
- `null`

Plus arrays of any of the above.

#### Dynamic arguments

Dynamic arguments are nearly identical to variables. Knock will expect a string formatted like `"<prefix>.<path>"` and use the information within to resolve a value from some runtime data property.

Knock allows the following dynamic argument formats:

<!-- TODO(KNO-3048): do we support dynamic message status conditions? -->

| Argument | Description |
| - | - |
| `data.<path>` | `<path>` is used to select a property from the workflow trigger data payload. |
| `recipient.<prop>` | `<prop>` is used to select a property on the current recipient. |
| `actor.<prop>` | `<prop>` is used to select a property on the current actor. |
| `var.<var>` | `<var>` is the name of one of your environment variables. |
| `workflow.{id,name,categories}` | Selects the `id`, `name`, or `categories` value for the current workflow. |
| `run.{total_activities,total_actors}` | Selects the `total_activities` or `total_actors` value for the current workflow run. |
| `tenant.<prop>` | `<prop>` is used to select a property on the current tenant. |

In cases where data is not found at the path given by the argument, Knock falls back to an empty string as the default value.

### Operators

You can use any of the following operators in condition comparisons:

| Operator                   | Description                      |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `equal_to`                 | `==`                             |
| `not_equal_to`             | `!=`                             |
| `greater_than`             | `>`                              |
| `greater_than_or_equal_to` | `>=`                             |
| `less_than`                | `<`                              |
| `less_than_or_equal_to`    | `<=`                             |
| `contains`                 | `argument in variable`           |
| `not_contains`             | `argument not in variable`       |
| `empty`                    | `variable in ["", null, []]`     |
| `not_empty`                | `variable not in ["", null, []]` |

The `empty` and `not_empty` operators do not require a companion argument value in the condition, since Knock is checking for the absence of data from the variable path.

## The conditions editor

The Knock Dashboard ships with a conditions editor that provides helpful abstractions on top of this data model. Rather than needing to remember how to format variables or name operators, Knock makes the appropriate options available to you.

When creating or modifying a condition, you'll see:

- A dropdown to select the condition type. Knock will use this option to determine the variable `<prefix>` value.
- An input or dropdown to provide the variable data path.
- A dropdown to select the operator.
- An input or dropdown to provide the argument data path.

You can also use the conditions editor to combine multiple conditions together via either 'AND' or 'OR' operators.

- `AND` combined conditions require all conditions to be true for the evaluation to pass.
- `OR` combined conditions require at least one condition to be true for the evaluation to pass.

The condition editor is available for use in the [workflow step editor](/designing-workflows#the-workflow-canvas) and the [channel environment settings editor](/integrations/overview#per-environment-configurations).

## Debugging conditions

Knock executes conditions for each workflow run. You can debug condition evaluation results in the [workflow debugger](/send-notifications/debugging-workflows). You'll see a log line that indicates that a step did not execute because one or more of your conditions were not met.
