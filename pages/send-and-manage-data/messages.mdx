## An overview

A Message in Knock represents a notification delivered to a [User](/send-and-manage-data/users) or an [Object](/send-and-manage-data/objects) on a particular channel. This is the core Knock data entity that your recipients will interact with when receiving notifications.

Knock exposes a set of [Message APIs](/reference#messages) via which you can query for notifications and update messages individually or in batches. The Knock [Feeds API](/reference#feeds) is a specialized view of messages delivered to an in-app feed channel.

The Knock dashboard makes available various message metadata to help you debug your notifications. This includes:

- Information about the request that triggered the delivery of the message.
- A preview of the message content as displayed for the recipient.
- Logs of requests between Knock and your channel provider as Knock works to deliver the message to the recipient.
- A timeline of message lifecycle events.

## Statuses

Messages have two types of statuses. These are:

- **Delivery statuses** — The delivery state of a message as reported by your channel provider. Delivery statuses are mutually exclusive and implicitly managed by Knock as part of notification delivery.
- **Engagement statuses** — The way in which the recipient has interacted with the notification. A message can have multiple engagment statuses, and you can manage them yourself via the Knock API.

Knock captures changes in message status as events that power [webhooks](/send-and-manage-data/webhooks) and our usage-based billing.

## Link and open tracking

Knock provides opt-in, provider agnostic tracking capabilities for your notifications. With link tracking, Knock will capture link-click actions by your recipients as a message event. With open tracking, Knock will embed tracking pixels in email channel messages to help gauge when recipients are opening and reading your email notifications.
