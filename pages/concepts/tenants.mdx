Tenants represent segments your users belong to. You might call these "accounts," "organizations," "workspaces," or similar. This is a common pattern in many SaaS applications: users have a single login joined to multiple tenants to represent their membership within each.

You use tenants in Knock to:

- Support a user having a separate notification feed per tenant
- Apply per-tenant branding in emails
- Define per-tenant preference defaults that apply to all users within that tenant
- Apply per-user, per-tenant preferences
- üîú Power per-tenant template overrides

## A conceptual model of tenants

A tenant in Knock:

- Is uniquely identified by an `id`, [per-environment](/send-and-manage-data/environments)
- Can have any number of custom properties
- Can store branding overrides and preference defaults
- Can be managed via the API

<Callout

  text={
    <>
      Behind the scenes, a tenant in Knock is really just another{" "}
      <a href="/send-and-manage-data/objects">Object</a> in a special-system
      defined collection, <code>$tenants</code>. That means that anything you
      can do on an object you can do on a tenant.
    </>
  }
/>

By default, Knock will create a stub tenant object for all unique tenants that you trigger a workflow run for. You can also use the [tenant APIs](/reference#tenants) to create and manage tenant objects from your system to Knock.

## Associating workflow runs with a tenant

It's important to note that tenants **do not** have a relationship to the [users](/send-and-manage-data/users) and [objects](/send-and-manage-data/objects) you've identified in Knock. That means Knock does not know _which tenant_ to associate with the set of users you're triggering a notification for. Instead, you must explicitly tell Knock as part of a workflow trigger to associate the workflow runs with a tenant.

<MultiLangCodeBlock
  snippet="workflows.trigger-with-tenant"
  title="Trigger a workflow with a tenant"
/>

Tenants have a loose coupling to your users so Knock does not need to know anything about the roles and permissions model associated with your product. This means you have less data to synchronize to Knock and reduces the risk of drift between what's current in your system and what's reflected in Knock. If you need to model groups or lists of users, you can use our [subscriptions model](/send-and-manage-data/subscriptions) to do that.

Once a workflow run has been triggered with a `tenant`, the Knock workflow engine will do the following:

- Find the tenant or create an empty `tenant` object if one does not exist
- Expose that tenant object to the workflow run scope as a `tenant` variable
- Associates all messages produced in the workflow run with the tenant
- Applies any branding overrides to templates rendered
- Applies any preference defaults to the recipient's preference set
- Fetches any recipient-specific tenant preference sets

## Using tenant data in a workflow run

The full tenant object will be exposed, including any custom properties, in the workflow run scope under the `tenant` [namespace](/designing-workflows/template-editor/variables#tenant).

You can then use the tenant in a workflow to:

- Add per-tenant-specific template changes, like custom messages or details.
- Create per-tenant conditions to only trigger steps for particular tenants.

```markdown Using tenant data in a notification template
# Hello from {{ tenant.name }}

This is a message directly from {{ tenant.name }} going to {{ recipient.email }}.
```

## Syncing tenant data to Knock

To get tenant data into Knock, we expose [various tenant-specific API methods](/reference#tenants). These methods make it possible to create or update a tenant, including any custom properties associated and any tenant settings, which include branding overrides and default preference sets.

## Messages and tenants

When a workflow is triggered with a `tenant` property, all of the [Messages](/send-and-manage-data/messages) produced in the workflow run will be tagged with the `id` of the tenant.

Tagging messages by the tenant makes it possible to query for tenant-specific messages in both the API and the dashboard. We also expose this behavior for in-app feed messages, making it possible to expose per-user, per-tenant feeds ([see below for an expanded guide](#scoping-in-app-feeds) on this usecase).

## Working with tenants in the Knock dashboard

Tenant data is also exposed in the Knock dashboard. From the dashboard it's possible to:

- View information about specific tenants, including custom properties set
- View message logs of messages generated that were associated with the tenant
- View workflow run information for all runs associated with the tenant
- View and set custom branding settings
- View default preferences set for a tenant

You can find tenant information under the "Tenants" section in the left-hand menu of the dashboard.

## Guides for using tenants

### Scoping in-app feeds

Multi-tenancy is important in your notification system when handling in-app feeds. Lets look at an example.
Imagine that we have a SaaS application, Collaborato, where our users belong to one or more different
workspaces. When one of our users is active in a current workspace, we want to make sure they only
see notifications that are relevant for that workspace. That is, a user in the "Acme Fish Co." workspace
should only see notifications that are relevant to "Acme Fish Co.".

#### Example

To support this use case within Knock, we can pass a `tenant` identifier into our trigger calls. This `tenant` does not have to be configured in any way beforehand, it can simply be a unique identifier you choose to represent this group.

<MultiLangCodeBlock
  snippet="workflows.trigger-with-tenant"
  title="Notify with tenant"
/>

When retrieving our feed to be displayed, we can then scope the feed to only show items relevant
to the tenant:

```jsx Client-side feed scoping
// If you're using our `client-js` SDK:
import Knock from "@knocklabs/client";
const knockClient = new Knock(process.env.KNOCK_PUBLIC_API_KEY);

const feedClient = knockClient.feeds.initialize(
  process.env.KNOCK_FEED_CHANNEL_ID,
  {
    // Scope all requests to the current workspace
    tenant: currentWorkspace.id,
  },
);

// Or if you're using the React SDK:
<KnockFeedProvider
  apiKey={process.env.KNOCK_PUBLIC_API_KEY}
  feedId={process.env.KNOCK_FEED_CHANNEL_ID}
  userId={currentUser.id}
  defaultFeedOptions={{ tenant: currentWorkspace.id }}
>
  ...
</KnockFeedProvider>;
```

By providing the `tenant` property here, we're letting Knock know that the notifications produced
in the `trigger` call belong to a particular tenant and when we're showing the feed to our customers we **only** want to see the feed that's related to that tenant.

Under the hood Knock will ensure that the badge counts you receive for the feed will be relevant
only to the active workspace, and that no real-time notifications will be received for any messages
that aren't relevant to the user.

### Custom branding

      <span className="font-bold">Enterprise plan feature.</span> Per-tenant
      branding is only available on our{" "}
      <a href="https://knock.app/pricing">Enterprise plan</a>.
    </>
  }
/>

You can use tenants to define default branding settings when sending email notifications that override your account-level brand settings. When you trigger a workflow with a `tenant`, it will use any settings defined on that tenant in place of the account-level brand settings to style your email layout steps.

#### Example

Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre a hospitality company and own two boutique hotels, ‚ÄúThe Black Lodge‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Great Northern.‚Äù Both want custom branding for their reservation update emails.

First, we‚Äôll want to add both of these hotels as `Tenants`. Navigate to the ‚ÄúTenants‚Äù tab on the main sidebar of your dashboard and click ‚ÄúCreate tenant." There, you‚Äôll add a name and unique ID by which you'll reference the tenant when triggering notifications. You can also upload a logo, an icon, and select primary colors directly from the interface here.

Now that the tenant is set up, when you trigger a workflow with an email step you can pass the ID for one of these tenants. It will override the account branding settings with the settings you configured for your tenant. If you want to send a reservation reminder to the guests of The Black Lodge, you can pass the ID you set for that hotel, `black-lodge`, into the tenant field of the workflow trigger option to override default account settings with those you've created for this tenant.

### Per-tenant user preferences and tenant preference defaults

      user preferences and tenant preference defaults are only available on our{" "}
      <a href="https://knock.app/pricing">Enterprise plan</a>.
    </>
  }
/>

Another advanced tenancy use case is managing different sets of preferences for each user-tenant pair. That is, a user may have different preferences configured for "Acme Fish Co." than they do for "Bell's Bagels", two hypothetical workspaces within our example collaboration app, Collaborato.

We also support the ability to set per-tenant defaults, where an admin in a tenant within your product can set the default preferences for all users within that tenant.

You can learn more about how to set per-tenant preferences and tenant preference defaults in [our preferences guide](/send-and-manage-data/preferences#per-tenant-preference-sets).

## Frequently asked questions

**What's the limit on the number of tenants I can sync into Knock?**<br />
There are no limits associated with tenants.

**Can I use tenants on a non-enterprise plan?**<br />
Yes, you can still use our APIs to work with tenant data, and trigger workflow runs for specific tenants. However, per-tenant preferences and custom branding are features gated for enterprise plans only.

**How does Knock map my user access permissions onto a tenant?**<br />
Knock does not know anything about the mapping between your users and your tenant entities, meaning you do not need to map user permissions.

**Can I use a tenant as a recipient in a workflow trigger?**<br />
Absolutely, you can trigger a workflow as a `recipient` or as the `actor` in a workflow trigger as an object reference with the structure `{ collection: "$tenants", id: "tenant-id" }`.

**Can I subscribe recipients to a tenant?**<br />
Yes, you can subscribe recipients to a tenant by setting the collection of the object to subscribe to as `$tenants` and using the `id` of the tenant as the object id.

**Can I create per-tenant templates?**<br />
We're currently working on this feature to create per-tenant template overrides at the workflow step level. If you're interested in being an early adopter of this feature, or this is blocking your adoption of Knock, [please get in touch](mailto:support@knock.app?subject=Per-tenant%20templates).

**Can I create per-tenant workflows?**<br />
While it's technically possible to create per-tenant workflows in Knock, we recommend not doing this where possible and opting to use our step conditions, preferences, and per-tenant templates to provide the customizations you need. The reason is creating and managing per-tenant workflows increases the surface area of the number of notifications you need to support, and more commonly what we've found from working with customers is there are more similarities between per-customer workflows than differences, which can usually be encapsulated in our workflow model.

If you find that you have different needs here, we'd love to speak with you. Please [get in touch](mailto:support@knock.app) and we can arrange a consultation with a notification support specialist on the Knock team to walk through your use case.

**Can I nest tenants?**<br />
No, today it's only possible to have a single-level of hierarchy for your tenants. If you need to apply deeper hierarchy to your tenant objects, please [get in touch](mailto:support@knock.app) and we can discuss your use case further.
