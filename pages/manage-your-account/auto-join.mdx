## Overview

The account auto-join policy allows new users to join your account without the need of an invitation.

## Add domains for auto-join

As an owner/admin you can manage your auto-join settings under the `General tab` of your account settings: `dashboard.knock.app/<slug>/settings` where the `slug` is your account identifier (e.g. `foo-corp`).

Here you are able to add or remove domains for auto-join.
The available domains you can add are the ones related to owners from your account.

Once you have selected at least one domain for auto-join, any new user with an email that matches that domain will be joined to your account after signing in.

      accounts with public domains.
    </>
  }

## Member roles

Knock provides different type of [roles](/manage-your-account/roles-and-permissions), but for now all users joined with this policy will be `members` by default.

You can always [manage your members](/manage-your-account/managing-members) and change their roles in order to fit your needs.

## Auto-join and invitations

In case you want to add a user (which has the same domain you selected for auto-join) but with a different role than `member`, you can use an invitation choosing the role you prefer.

We prioritize invitations over the auto-join policy, which means new users with pending invitations will not be directly auto-joined.
