## Overview

The account auto-join policy allows new users to join your account without the need of an invitation.

## Add domains for auto-join

As an owner you can manage your auto-join settings under the `General` tab of your account settings: `dashboard.knock.app/<slug>/settings` where the `slug` is your account identifier (e.g. `foo-corp`)

Here you are able to add or remove domains for auto-join. The available domains are the ones related to owners from your account.

Once you have selected at least one domain for auto-join, any new user with an email that matches that domain will be joined to your account after signing in.

      accounts with public domains.
    </>
  }

## User's roles after auto-join

Knock provides different type of [roles](/manage-your-account/roles-and-permissions) for users, but for now all users joined with this policy will be `members`.
