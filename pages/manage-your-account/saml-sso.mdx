## SSO configuration

First, navigate to the Security tab under your account settings. You'll need to be an account owner to access the Security tab.

Click on the "Connect SSO provider" button to get redirected to the SAML SSO
configuration wizard, on which you will be able to pick your identity provider
and configure it.

After completing the steps of the configuration walkthrough, SAML will be successfully configured for your account.
This will allow users with emails under your domain to be able to log in successfully through the provider you
have configured.

      domain as your own. If your setup requires support for more than one
      domain, contact support.

## SSO authentication

Once SAML SSO is configured on your account, all members will be required to log in using the provider you
configured. When visiting the login screen, users must use the email field to start the authentication flow.
Users will **not be allowed to authenticate** using other authentication methods while SAML SSO is enabled on your account.
