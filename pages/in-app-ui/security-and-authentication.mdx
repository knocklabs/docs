Authentication ensures your users can securely access the Knock API from your client
applications, without you exposing your secret API key and allowing blanket
access.

**Note:** This integration guide references examples from our [client-side JS SDK](https://github.com/knocklabs/knock-client-js). You only need to add the authentication outlined in this guide if you're integrating Knock on the client-side of
your applications to use the Knock in-app feed or the Knock preferences model.

## API endpoints that require auth

The following calls require authentication (when called from the client):

- Fetching a user's notification feed
- Marking a message as read, seen, or archived
- Getting or setting a users preferences

## Authentication (in development environments)

In a Knock development environment, you can use your public key to authenticate all users. You do not need to implement any other security mechanisms.

**Client SDK example**

```js
import Knock from "@knocklabs/client";

const knockClient = new Knock(process.env.KNOCK_PUBLIC_API_KEY);

// Tell Knock to use the users id
knockClient.authenticate(currentUser.id);
```

**React notification feed example**

```jsx
<KnockFeedProvider
  // Rest omitted for brevity
  apiKey={process.env.KNOCK_PUBLIC_API_KEY}
  userId={currentUser.id}
>
```

**Note:** in production environments you **will need to authenticate your users using a secure user token**. This ensures
that your user's content is protected and cannot be read by malicious actors.

## Authentication (in production environments)

Using our JWT-based authentication approach means using a shared secret to sign a new JWT on your
backend. This means you can generate the authentication token out-of-band without an additional network request.

### 1. Generate the signing key

You can find the signing key in the Knock dashboard under the "Developers" page. Save the private
key shown to you here. Note: you won't be shown this key again, so you'll need to regenerate
it if you lose access.

### 2. Sign the JWT

Within your backend application, you'll need to sign the JWT and make it available to your front-end
client. Usually, you'll do this by passing it down as a serialized property on the user, or passing in a cookie.

At a minimum the JWT to be signed must have:

```json
{
  // The user that you're signing the token for
  "sub": "user_id",
  // When the token was issued
  "iat": 1608600116,
  // Expiry timestamp
  "exp": 1608603716
}
```

To sign your JWT as middleware in a NodeJS express like app:

```js
const jwt = require("jsonwebtoken");

app.use((req, res, next) => {
  if (!req.user) {
    return next();
  }

  // JWT NumericDates specified in seconds:
  const currentTime = Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000);

  res.locals({
    knockToken: jwt.sign(
      {
        sub: req.user.id,
        iat: currentTime,
        exp: currentTime + 60 * 60, // 1 hour from now
      },
      process.env.KNOCK_SIGNING_KEY,
      {
        algorithm: "RS256",
      },
    ),
  });
  next();
});
```

### 3. Send the JWT to the client

In your client application you can now use the JWT to authenticate with Knock:

**Client SDK example**

```js
import Knock from "@knocklabs/client";

const knockClient = new Knock(process.env.KNOCK_PUBLIC_API_KEY);

// Tell Knock to use the users id and the token for the user
knockClient.authenticate(currentUser.id, currentUser.knockToken);
```

**React notification feed example**

```jsx
<KnockFeedProvider
  // Rest of props omitted for brevity
  apiKey={process.env.KNOCK_PUBLIC_API_KEY}
  userId={currentUser.id}
  userToken={currentUser.knockUserToken}
>
```

## Avoiding authentication

You can avoid authentication altogether by proxying requests to Knock via your backend, although we don't recommend this approach as it will add more latency for your users.

## Troubleshooting

### Errors using your Knock signing key

If you are getting errors like
`secretOrPrivateKey must be an asymmetric key when using RS256`, you may need to
wrap your signing key in JSON:
      
```javascript
// .env.local
KNOCK_SIGNING_KEY='{"key": "-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\nMIIJKgIBA....\n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n"}'

/// In your app when you sign your JWT...
const jwt = require("jsonwebtoken");

// Extract the signing key from the environment variable
const signingKey = JSON.parse(process.env.KNOCK_SIGNING_KEY).key;

app.use((req, res, next) => {
// ...
```
