Our `@knocklabs/react-notification-feed` library can be used to build full-page inbox experiences, too. In this guide we'll show you how to have a basic inbox ready for your users in a few minutes.

## Getting started

To use this example, you'll need [an account on Knock](https://dashboard.knock.app), as well as an in-app feed channel with a workflow that produces in-app feed messages. You'll also need:

- A public API key for the Knock environment (set as `KNOCK_PUBLIC_API_KEY`)
- The channel ID for the in-app feed (set as `KNOCK_FEED_CHANNEL_ID`)

## Installing dependencies

```bash Installing dependencies
npm install @knocklabs/react-notification-feed
```

## Rendering the notification inbox

Here we're using the `KnockFeedProvider` to authenticate our current user and connect them to a Knock In-app Feed Channel. We then render the `NotificationFeed` component to give us a simple, complete notification inbox page.

```jsx
import {
  KnockFeedProvider,
  NotificationFeed,
} from "@knocklabs/react-notification-feed";

const NotificationInbox = () => {
  // An example of fetching the current authenticated user
  const { user } = useCurrentUser();

  return (
    <KnockFeedProvider
      apiKey={process.env.KNOCK_PUBLIC_API_KEY}
      feedId={process.env.KNOCK_FEED_CHANNEL_ID}
      userId={user.id}
    >
      <NotificationFeed />
    </KnockFeedProvider>
  );
};
```
