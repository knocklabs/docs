title: "Building preference UIs in React"

In this guide we'll look at building a simple preference center UI for our users in Knock using the preference APIs available in Knock to do so.

## Getting started

## Installing dependencies

## Creating our preference center

The next step here is to create our preference center. What we'll do here is:

1. Read the set of preferences from Knock for the authenticated user and use that to drive the UI.
2. Whenever a preference is changed, we'll update the preferences in Knock with the new value.

The nice thing about this approach is we don't need to store any notification preferences in our application, and we can use Knock as the source of truth for the notification preferences a user currently has set.

## Wrapping up
