Our [`@knocklabs/react-notification-feed`](https://github.com/knocklabs/react-notification-feed) library lets you create notification experiences using Knock's notification feeds APIs. It comes with pre-built UI components that you can use to easily get up-and-running with a fully functional notification feeds experience in your product.

## Quick start

To get started, you'll need an [account on Knock](https://dashboard.knock.app), as well as your public API key.

```bash Installing the package
npm install @knocklabs/react-notification-feed
```

To add a real-time notifications feed to your product, you can add:

```jsx
import { useState, useRef } from "react";
import {
  KnockFeedProvider,
  NotificationIconButton,
  NotificationFeedPopover,
} from "@knocklabs/react-notification-feed";

// Required CSS import, unless you're overriding the styling
import "@knocklabs/react-notification-feed/dist/index.css";

const YourAppLayout = () => {
  const [isVisible, setIsVisible] = useState(false);
  const notifButtonRef = useRef(null);

  return (
    <KnockFeedProvider
      apiKey={process.env.KNOCK_PUBLIC_API_KEY}
      feedId={process.env.KNOCK_FEED_ID}
      userId={currentUser.id}
    >
      <>
        <NotificationIconButton
          ref={notifButtonRef}
          onClick={(e) => setIsVisible(!isVisible)}
        />
        <NotificationFeedPopover
          buttonRef={notifButtonRef}
          isVisible={isVisible}
          onClose={() => setIsVisible(false)}
        />
      </>
    </KnockFeedProvider>
  );
};
```
