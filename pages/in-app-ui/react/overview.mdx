title: "Building in-app UI in React"
---

Our [`@knocklabs/react-notification-feed`](https://github.com/knocklabs/react-notification-feed) library lets you create notification experiences using Knock's notification feeds APIs. It comes with pre-built UI components that you can use to easily get up-and-running with a fully functional notification feeds experience in your product.

You can also use the library to build:

- [Floating notification feeds](/in-app-ui/react/feed)
- [Real-time notification toasts](/in-app-ui/react/toasts)
- [Notification inboxes](/in-app-ui/react/inbox)
- [Custom notification UI](/in-app-ui/react/custom-ui)
- [Notification preferences](/in-app-ui/react/preferences)
