Our [`@knocklabs/react-native`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@knocklabs/react-native) library lets you create in-app notification experiences in React Native powered applications using Knock's client APIs.

The React Native library is built on top of the `@knocklabs/client` JS SDK and includes that library as an implicit dependency.

**Quick links:**

- [`@knocklabs/react-native` on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@knocklabs/react-native)
- [`@knocklabs/client` on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@knocklabs/client)
- [Full reference](/in-app-ui/react-native/reference)
- [JS SDK reference](/in-app-ui/javascript/reference)

Using the React Native SDK it's possible to build:

- [Notification feeds](/in-app-ui/react-native/notification-feeds) that update in real time
- Notification preference control centers

Our React library is worked on full-time by the Knock JavaScript team.
