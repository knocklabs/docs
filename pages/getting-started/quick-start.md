title: Quick start

In this guide you'll integrate Knock with your application and send your first notification using Knock.

## Integrate with your app

### 1. Add the Knock SDK to your backend

We have SDKs available in [NodeJS](https://github.com/knocklabs/knock-node), [Python](https://github.com/knocklabs/knock-python), and [Elixir](https://github.com/knocklabs/knock-elixir). Don't see your language listed here? [Let us know](mailto:support@knock.app)!

```bash
npm install @knocklabs/node
```

### 2. Setup environment variables

You can find your API key under the 'Developers' section of the Knock dashboard. As a best practice, your API key should be set as an environment variable and should not be checked into source control.

```bash
KNOCK_API_KEY='sk_example_123456789'
```

### 3. Tell Knock about your users

Knock needs to know about your users to be able to send them messages. At a minimum we need the user's name, email address, and a unique id with which to identify them.

You'll keep user information up to date in Knock using the `identify` call.
Best practice is to make an identify call to Knock when a new user is created and when any Knock-relevant user property changes. This way your user data is always up to date in Knock and we have what we need to send them messages.

🔐 **Security first** 🔐

We don't take your user data lightly. For more on our security practices, both in our API and in our dashboard, check out our [security documentation](https://knock.app).

```javascript
const Knock = require("@knocklabs/node");
const knock = new Knock(process.env.KNOCK_API_KEY);

app.post("/signup", async (req, res) => {
  const user = Users.signup_user(req.params);

  await knock.users.identify(user.id, {
    name: user.name,
    email: user.email,
    avatar: user.avatar_url,
  });

  res.json(user.serialize());
});
```

### 4. Create your workflow in Knock

Next we'll log into the Knock dashboard to create our first workflow in Knock.

A workflow takes a `notify` call, runs it through a set of logic configured by you in the Knock dashboard, and outputs the actual messages that will be sent to your end users. All channel routing and message design takes place within the workflow.

To create your first workflow, log into the [Knock dashboard](https://dashboard.knock.app) and click "+ Workflow" in the top right corner. We're going to be using the "New comment" template for this example, so select that template and we're all set. Before we head back to our BE, we'll want to jump into the workflow and pull out the sample payload—this is auto-generated by the workflow creation process within the Knock dashboard and gives us the JSON blob we'll need to pass through as data in our notify call to populate any of the custom properties required in our workflow.

### 5. Trigger your workflow

When you want to notify a set of users simply call the `notify` function to trigger the workflow you want to send. When calling the `notify` function, you'll pass in the `recipients` you want to receive messages sent by the workflow, as well as the `data` (which we received during step 4) required to populate those messages.

```javascript
const Knock = require("@knocklabs/node");
const knock = new Knock(process.env.KNOCK_API_KEY);

// In our hypothetical document collaboration app
// we want to let Knock know about comments being created.
// We send this after the comment has been saved to the database
await knock.notify("new-comment", {
  // The user that triggered this workflow
  actor: comment.user_id,
  // Template data we want to use
  data: {
    document_id: comment.document.id,
    document_name: comment.document.name,
    comment_id: comment.id,
    comment_text: comment.text,
  },
  // Who should be notified
  recipients: document.followers.map((f) => f.user_id),
});
```

### 6. Publish to production

Knock uses a [logically separated environment](/send-and-manage-data/environments) model to control the roll-out of your notifications.
When you're happy with the way your workflows work and look, you just need to publish them to
production to start sending notifications to your real users.
