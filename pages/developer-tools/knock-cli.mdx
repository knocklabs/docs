The Knock CLI is a convienient way to interact with the resources within your Knock account from the terminal. You can use the CLI to:

- Pull down your Knock workflows to your local machine and make changes to the notification templates.
- Synchronize the translation files that power your notifications.
- Integrate Knock into your CI/CD pipeline and automatically promote changes between Knock environments on release.

## Installing the CLI

You can install the Knock CLI using `npx`, a node package runner that ships with npm, with the following command:

```bash Installing the Knock CLI
npx install -g @knocklabs/cli
```

Once the CLI is installed, you can call it by using the `knock` command in your terminal.

## Authenticating the CLI

The Knock CLI relies on [service tokens](/developer-tools/service-tokens) in order to authenticate against your Knock account. Once you have a service token generated, you can verify you can call Knock by running `knock ping --service-token=YOUR_SERVICE_TOKEN`.

## CLI reference

You can find a complete reference for all of the commands and flags available on the [CLI in our comprehensive reference](/cli).
