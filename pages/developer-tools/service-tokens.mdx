      The Knock management API is currently in beta. If you'd like early access,
      or this is blocking your adoption of Knock, please{" "}

A Knock account service token allows for secure access against the Knock Management API and CLI. It acts as an authentication mechanism for resources under your Knock account.

Service tokens always start with `knock_st_` and are different from your Knock API keys as they authenticate requests to the Knock management API **only**.

      Note: <strong>only account owners</strong> have the privilege to generate
      (or revoke) service tokens. Service tokens will inherit the owner
      privilege and therefore have full access to the management API.
    </>

## Generating a new service token

To access the management API or CLI, you will first need to generate a service token and use it as a means of authentication when sending requests.

You can do so by going to the "Service tokens" tab in your account "Settings" page, then click the “+ New token” button.

Please note: once generated you **cannot see a service token again from the Knock dashboard, so be sure to copy it to a secure location**.

## Revoking a service token

Service tokens can be revoked under the three-dot menu and by clicking on "Delete token". Deleting a token will **immediately** revoke its ability to be used against the Knock management API and CLI.

## Frequently asked questions

**Can I use a Knock service token against the Knock API?**

No, a service token can only be used against the Knock Management API and not the Knock API.

**How can I know which changes were made by a specific service token?**

Internally we audit requests and tie them back to a corresponding service token. If you need help understanding which request originated from a service token, please [contact our support team](mailto:support@knock.app).
