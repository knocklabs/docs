The functions available in the Knock workflow builder and how they work.

## Overview

In this guide we'll talk about the different functions available to you when building workflows in Knock.

At a high-level, a function is a step in a workflow that does something to the data being passed in your notify call. You can use functions by entering the workflow builder and adding function steps to the canvas.

Today we support two functions: [batch](/send-notifications/workflow-functions/batch) and [delay](/send-notifications/workflow-functions/delay).

## How the Knock notification engine works

As you start to dig into workflow functions, it's helpful to understand the basics of what happens in Knock when you [trigger a workflow](/send-notifications/triggering-workflows).

When Knock receives a workflow trigger (like the one below) for one of your workflows, it will produce a **workflow run** for **each recipient** you send in your workflow trigger.

```js A workflow trigger for three recipients
await knock.notify("comment-created", {
  // The user who performed the action (optional)
  actor: "user_0",
  // The list of recipients
  recipients: ["user_1", "user_2", "user_3"],
  // Data to be passed to the template
  data: {
    page_name: "Marketing brief",
    comment_body: "Hey team â€”Â can we take another look at this?",
  },
});
```

In the example above we've included three recipients, so our workflow trigger will produce three separate workflow runs. Keep this in mind when you're thinking about how to use functions in your workflow run.

## Available functions

### Batch

A batch function collects notifications that have to do with the same subject, so you can send fewer notifications to your users.

### Delay

A delay function does just what it sounds like: it delays the execution of the workflow for some amount of time, then proceeds to the next step.
