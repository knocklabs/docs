Canceling a workflow allows you to stop the sending of messages within a specified workflow for
one or more recipients. This can be useful in settings like reminders where a notification needs
to be canceled once a user has performed the intended action.

It's important to understand that only workflows that include a delay function or a batch function can be canceled within Knock, as without the built-in delay of a function Knock will _immediately_ send a notification to your recipients.

## Canceling a triggered workflow

To perform a cancellation, you first need to give Knock a pointer to understand how to uniquely
identify the triggered workflow by providing a `cancellation_key` on the `notify` call.

You can read about generating workflow cancellation keys and some best practices in the
[triggering workflows guide](/send-notifications/triggering-workflows#generating-a-cancellation-key).

### Schema

| Property         | Type                  | Description                                                                    |
| ---------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| key\*            | string                | The human readable key of the workflow from the Knock dashboard                |
| cancellation_key | string                | A unique identifier for the workflow run                                       |
| recipients       | RecipientIdentifier[] | A list of specific recipient identifiers to cancel the workflow for (optional) |

## Canceling for subsets of recipients

In some cases you may need to cancel a workflow for a subset of recipients only. You can do this
by specifying the recipients list on the cancellation:

<MultiLangCodeBlock
  snippet="workflows.cancel-with-recipients"
  title="Canceling for subsets of recipients"
/>

## Cancellation gotchas

There are a few things to watch out for when using cancellations:

1. A cancellation cannot be performed on a specific channel step, it can only be performed against
   the _entire_ workflow.

2. You cannot cancel a given workflow run after it has finished ; if you need to revoke messages for
   persistent channels like the in-app feed, then you can `archive` a message instead.

You can learn more about using cancellation with batch and delay functions in our [workflow functions guide](/send-notifications/workflow-functions#using-workflow-cancellation-with-batches).
