Canceling a workflow allows you to stop a workflow run mid-execution. This action will stop the workflow from sending new messages to recipients. This can be useful in situations like reminder workflows, where a notification needs to be canceled once a user has performed an intended action.

Only workflows with a step that can pause the run can be canceled, since otherwise Knock will _immediately_ send a notification to your recipients. The three steps that can pause a workflow run are:

- [Batch functions](/send-notifications/designing-workflows/batch-function) will pause workflows while the batch window is open.
- [Delay functions](/send-notifications/designing-workflows/delay-function) will pause workflows for the configured delay window.
- [Fetch functions](/send-notifications/designing-workflows/fetch-function) may pause workflows during a [retry backoff](/send-notifications/designing-workflows/fetch-function#error-handling).

## Canceling a triggered workflow

To perform a cancellation, you first need to provide a `cancellation_key` in the [workflow trigger](/send-notifications/triggering-workflows) request. Knock will use this key to uniquely identify the triggered workflow for cancellation.

You can read about generating workflow cancellation keys and some best practices in the [triggering workflows guide](/send-notifications/triggering-workflows#generating-a-cancellation-key).

### Schema

| Property         | Type                  | Description                                                                    |
| ---------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| key\*            | string                | The human readable key of the workflow from the Knock dashboard                |
| cancellation_key | string                | A unique identifier for the workflow run                                       |
| recipients       | RecipientIdentifier[] | A list of specific recipient identifiers to cancel the workflow for (optional) |

## Canceling for subsets of recipients

In some cases you may need to cancel a workflow for a subset of recipients only. You can do this by specifying the recipients list on the cancellation:

<MultiLangCodeBlock
  snippet="workflows.cancel-with-recipients"

## Gotchas and recommendations

There are a few fundamentals to consider when using workflow cancellations:

1. A cancellation cannot be performed on a specific channel step, it can only be performed against the _entire_ workflow.

2. You cannot cancel a given workflow run after it has finished. If you need to revoke messages for persistent channels like the in-app feed, then you can `archive` a message instead.

3. Workflow cancellations are both deferred and executed concurrently to the workflow run itself. The [cancel workflow API](/reference#cancel-workflow) will return a `204 No Content` response on success, but this only means Knock has successfully enqueued the cancellation request, _not_ that the cancellation has been performed. We recommend that you **issue a cancellation request no less than 5 seconds after a workflow trigger**, otherwise your cancellation request is susceptible to a race condition and Knock may not cancel your workflow run.
