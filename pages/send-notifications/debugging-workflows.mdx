title: Debugging workflows
---

Sometimes you'll encounter issues with a workflow run that require more visibility into the Knock engine. Knock comes pre-built with a powerful workflow debugger that you can use to understand the state of individual workflow runs.

Using the workflow debugger, you can answer questions such as:

- What messages did this workflow run generate?
- Why did this step not produce any messages?
- Did this recipient have preferences set that opted them out from receiving a notification?
- What prevented this step from executing?

You can see a video of our workflow debugger in action here:

    style={{
      position: "absolute",
      top: 0,
      left: 0,
      width: "100%",
      height: "100%",
    }}
  ></iframe>
</div>

## Accessing the workflow debugger

You can access the workflow debugger from our "Logs" page, which you'll find in the left hand environment sidebar in the dashboard. From there:

1. Find an API log that triggered a workflow run (**hint**: you can use the filters to find only workflow API requests)
2. In the right hand panel, click the "Workflow runs" tab
3. Select a workflow run for any recipient to view the debugger

**Note**: you can also use the debugger to look at test runs as well.
