A delay function does just what it sounds like: it delays the execution of the workflow for some amount of time, then proceeds to the next step. There are two types of delays we support in Knock today: "wait for set interval" and "wait until timestamp".

## Wait for set interval

The "wait for set interval" delay type waits for an interval of time (provided by you in the workflow editor) and then proceeds to the next step.

Set interval delay functions are helpful for the following use cases:

- Check to see if a user's seen or read an in-app message before sending an email
- Remind a user about a pending invite they haven't accepted

## Wait until timestamp

The "wait until timestamp" delay type waits until a specific point in time provided by you in the `data` of your notify call, then proceeds to the next step.

Timestamp-based delays are helpful for reminders about resources in your product that need to be completed or addressed by a specific point in time. As an example, if a user has a task that's due three days from now and you want to remind them 24 hours before it's due, you can set a timestamp delay for the task's due date minus 24 hours.

## Using workflow cancellation with delays

In cases where you're waiting to see if a user will complete an action before sending a notification, you can use our [workflow cancellation API](/send-notifications/canceling-workflows) to ensure a user doesn't receive an unnecessary reminder.

If the user completes the action you were going to remind them about, cancel the workflow to keep any additional notifications from being sent.
