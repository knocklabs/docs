Trigger conditions allow you to specify if a given step will execute at workflow execution time. They provide a powerful way to create more advanced notification workflow logic.

Some examples of triggers you can employ are:

- Only send an email if an in-app notification was not previously read or seen
- Only send an in-app notification if the `recipient.plan == "pro"`
- Only execute a delay step if `delay == true` in the workflow trigger

## Building trigger conditions

Trigger conditions are created and edited on each step by selecting the step in the workflow canvas. Each trigger condition is made up of a `variable`, `operator`, `argument` triple.

### Available variables

A trigger can be set on any of the following variables:

- **data**: Target a property within the `data` payload of the workflow trigger
- **recipient**: Target a property of the current `recipient` of the workflow run
- **actor**: Target a property of the current `actor` of the workflow run
- **refs**: Target the message status of a previously executed channel step in the workflow

### Available operators

You can use any of the following operators in condition comparisons:

| Operator                   | Description                      |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `equal_to`                 | `==`                             |
| `not_equal_to`             | `!=`                             |
| `greater_than`             | `>`                              |
| `greater_than_or_equal_to` | `>=`                             |
| `less_than`                | `<`                              |
| `less_than_or_equal_to`    | `<=`                             |
| `contains`                 | `argument in variable`           |
| `not_contains`             | `argument not in variable`       |
| `empty`                    | `variable in ["", null, []]`     |
| `not_empty`                | `variable not in ["", null, []]` |

### Available arguments

Arguments can be static (like fixed strings, numbers, or booleans) or dynamic properties. All of the following are valid arguments:

**Static properties**

- Fixed strings (`foo`, `bar`, `baz`)
- Fixed floats and numbers (`1.0`, `2`, `10000`)
- `true`, `false`, `null`

**Dynamic properties**

- `data.*`: Selects a property within the data payload of the workflow trigger (falling back to an empty string)
- `recipient.*`: Selects a property on the current `recipient` (falling back to an empty string)
- `actor.*`: Selects a property on the current `actor` (falling back to an empty string)

## Combining trigger conditions

One or more trigger conditions can be combined as either 'AND' or 'OR' operators when building conditions on the step.

- `AND` combined conditions require all conditions to be true before the step executes
- `OR` combined conditions require at least one condition to be true before the step executes

## Debugging trigger conditions

You can debug trigger conditions on each step in the [workflow debugger](/send-notifications/debugging-workflows). You'll see a log line that indicates that the step did not execute because one or more trigger conditions were not met.

## Example: conditionally sending an email if an in-app notification was not seen
