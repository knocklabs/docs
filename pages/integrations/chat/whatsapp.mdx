Knock integrates with [WhatsApp](https://www.whatsapp.com/) to send notifications to your recipients.

## Features

- Per environment configuration
- Sandbox mode

## Getting started

Before you set up your WhatsApp chat channel in Knock, you'll need to take the following steps in WhatsApp.

### 1. Create a business app on Facebook

Login to your [Facebook developer account](https://www.facebook.com/index.php?next=https%3A%2F%2Fdevelopers.facebook.com%2Fapps) and click on the "Create app button",
then choose the first "Business" type app and complete the details with your personal information.

### 2. Add WhatsApp as a product

Now that your app is created you need to add a product, scroll down to find the "WhatsApp" product and click "Set up".
After this you will be redirected to the WhatsApp get started page, here you can "create a businnes account" or use an existing one.

### 3. Send a test message

In case you want to [send a test message](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/get-started/#sent-test-message), you can go to _WhatsApp/first steps_, where you will find the **temporary access token**, **phone number id** and a **curl of send messages**.

![Send test message](/images/integrations/chat/whatsapp/first_steps.jpg)

The **phone number id** is from a Facebook test phone number (you cannot use it in production).

Then you need to add your personal number in the **recipient phone number field** and click on "Send message"

      Keep in mind that to configure Knock, you are looking for your{" "}
      <strong>WhatsApp Access Token</strong> and your{" "}
      <strong>Phone Number Id</strong> (not your phone number). <br></br>
    </>
  }
/>

### 4. Add a valid business phone number

[Add a business phone number](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/get-started/add-a-phone-number)
to send messages from. You can do this using the _Add Phone Number_ button which is below
the current page.

### 5. Generate a never expires access token

Because the testing access token only last 24 hours, we need to create a token that can last forever:

1. Create an admin user. To do this you need to go to the [business settings page](https://business.facebook.com/settings).
   You will see the [system users](https://business.facebook.com/settings) under the section of Users on the left sidebar.
   After you have created your new user click on _Add Assets_ and choose _App>Select App Name>Full control option_ and save changes.

2. Click on _WhatsApp Accounts_ on the left sidebar and then select the WhatsApp business app and click the _Add people_ button.
   Then choose the recently created system user and check the **full control option** and click the Assing button.

3. Go back to the system users page and select the recently created system user from the list. Then click the **Generate new token** button.
   Choose your app from the dropdown and make sure the **whatsapp_business_management** and **whatsapp_business_messaging** options are checked.

### 6. Add a message template

The only way of starting a business conversation with a client is using [message templates](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/api/messages/message-templates/).
In order to use this you must go to your [message templates dashboard](https://business.facebook.com/wa/manage/message-templates/?business_id=502240478585475&waba_id=110249001878279) and click "Create template"

Then you must choose a **category**, **name** and **language** for your template and click "Continue".

![New template configuration](/images/integrations/chat/whatsapp/new_template_configuration.jpg)

After creating your template you will gain access to your editor, where you must add a **Body** for your message (you can also add a _Header_, _Footer_ or a _Button_ if you want)

<Callout

      Here you can use parameters <strong>{"{{1}}"}</strong>, which are
      dynamically incorporated into the message. These are going to be overriden
      with the parameters you send in your template object with Knock
    </>
  }
/>

![Whatsapp Template editor](/images/integrations/chat/whatsapp/whatsapp_template_editor.jpg)

Once you have finished you must click on "Submit", then you have to wait for WhatsApp to [approve your template](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/message-templates/guidelines/) in order to start using it.

## Configuring WhatsApp in Knock

Now that you have a business **phone number id**, an **access token** and a **template message** you're ready to configure your WhatsApp channel within Knock.

### 1. Create a WhatsApp channel

You can create a new WhatsApp channel in the dashboard under the "Channels" section. From there, you'll need to configure the channel for each environment you have
using your **access token** and **phone number id**.

### 2. Send a template object

In order to use a WhatsApp template message, you must send a template object.
For this you must specify this object in your message body using your template editor and JSON (with Liquid if you want), following the next format:

![Knock message body](/images/integrations/chat/whatsapp/knock_template_editor.jpg)

<Callout
  emoji="🔦"
  text={
    <>
      Keep in mind that your <strong>{"{{template_name}}"}</strong> and{" "}
      <strong>{"{{template_language}}"}</strong> must be your WhatsApp message
      template name and language respectively.
      <br />
      Notice how the <strong> {"{{parameter}}"}</strong> is going to override
      the parameter from your WhatsApp template, and the amount of parameters
      you send here must the same you have in your WhatsApp template too.
    </>
  }
/>

## Additional information

Here are a few other things to keep in mind once you have your WhatsApp channel configured in Knock:

- **Deliverability tracking.** We cannot currently track deliverability through WhatsApp channels. This means that all notifications sent through WhatsApp will show up as "Sent" in the Knock messages log, but not "Delivered".

## Provider configuration

<Attributes>
  <Attribute

  <Attribute
    name="Phone Number ID"
    type="string*"
    description="The phone number ID associated with your business phone number"
  />
</Attributes>

## Recipient data requirements

In order to send a notification you'll need a valid `phone number` property set on your recipient.
