We make it effortless to send notifications to chat providers like Slack, Microsoft Teams, and Discord. Meet your users in the tools they use daily.

## Features

- **Markdown template builder**: use our markdown editor to create templates for each platform and let us take care of sending the platform-specific markup.
- **Use JSON to build interactive messages**: if you need to, it's easy to go to a fully customizable JSON template to power your chat notifications.
- **Cross-provider, single template**: you can send the same chat templated message across all chat providers to reduce the amount of templates to maintain.
- **Link tracking**: capture link-click events right within your Knock account. For more details, see the [Knock link tracking guide](/send-notifications/tracking).
