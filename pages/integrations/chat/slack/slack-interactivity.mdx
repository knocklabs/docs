In this guide we'll provide an overview of how to power interactive Slack notifications using Knock.

We'll cover:

- designing interactive templates
- handling interaction payloads from Slack

If you're brand new to building Slack interactive notifications, this [Slack guide on building actionable notifications](https://api.slack.com/tutorials/tracks/actionable-notifications) is a great place to learn the basics.

## Designing interactive Slack notification templates

To build an interactive Slack message, whether it contains a button, a dropdown, or some other input, you'll be using Slack's block kit UI framework. We cover how to build block-based Slack notifications within Knock in [our guide on designing Slack templates](/slack/designing-slack-templates).

## Handling interaction payloads from Slack

When a button in your interactive Slack notification is clicked, Slack will send an interaction payload to your app. To handle these interaction payloads you'll need to configure your Slack app with a Request URL. You can do this on the [app config page](https://api.slack.com/apps) of your Slack app. Go to the Interactivity & Shortcuts page of your Slack app and add your Request URL.
