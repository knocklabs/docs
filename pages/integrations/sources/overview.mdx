You can connect event sources or customer data platforms like Segment to Knock to automate workflows and other actions.

In general, each platform we support can do the following within Knock:

- Trigger workflows
- Identify (and update) users

## Why integrate Knock with an events platform?

- **Minimize engineering customization.** If you already identify and track users with a customer data platform (CDP), you can import your users and events within just a few minutes. Then, automate Knock by matching events to actions on our platform.
- **Ensure consistency.** CDPs make it easy to keep customer data synchronized between services, including Knock. Email, name, and other user trait updates can flow seamlessly into Knock without any engineering work.

## Concepts

### Sources

A source is a CDP or other event platform (like [Segment](/integrations/sources/segment)) that can trigger actions in Knock like creating/updating users and triggering workflows.

Knock currently supports the following sources:

- [Segment](/integrations/sources/segment)

You can configure sources from the Integrations > Sources page for your account.

Sources are created and managed at the top level of your account.

### Source Environments

Each source has a unique configuration for every Knock environment in your account.
For example, this makes it possible to connect your Segment development environment to your Knock development environment. 
If you click on a source, you will see each environment configuration for that source.

### Events

Knock tracks every event sent from a source. Although each source has its own event format,
Knock will translate the incoming events from each source into a common format that includes the following fields:

- `user_id`: the ID of the user performing a given action (may not be set if a user has not been identified yet).
- `data`: The primary contents of the event, e.g. for a Segment `track` with some associated `properties`, Knock would use those `properties` to set the `data` field for the event.
- `event`: The original event, as originally received by Knock.

### Event-Action Mapping

When a source sends an event to a Knock environment, Knock will match that event with any configured event-action mappings in that environment.

You can have any number of mappings for each event (e.g. if the same event should trigger more than one workflow).
If there is no mapping matching that event, the event is logged but no action is taken.

After configuring a source in Knock and in the source itself (e.g. adding Knock as a destination in your CDP), events will start to flow into your Knock environment.
You can then select the event you want to trigger actions in Knock, and configure it accordingly.

### Event Logs

Event logs show the contents of each event sent into Knock. Knock retains event Logs according to our data retention policy.

### Action Logs

Action logs describe what (if any) action was taken after an event was received. Action Logs are a helpful starting point when troubleshooting workflows or auditing what actions Knock has taken for any given event. Knock retains action logs according to our data retention policy.
