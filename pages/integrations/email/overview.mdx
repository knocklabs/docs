Effortlessly design and deliver email notifications to downstream providers, without the need to keep HTML templates in your backend codebase.

## Features

- **Easy to get started, and extend**: Knock email notifications look great out of the box. We include sensible, well tested, default responsive styles so you can get up and running quickly across all major email clients.
- **Block based visual editor**: Don't want to write HTML? No problem! You can use our drag-and-drop visual editor to get started.
- **Fully flexible templates and styling**: If you need to write custom HTML or CSS you can drop down to a raw code editor to create your email messages. You're never constrained to the templates Knock provides.
- **CSS inlining**: By default, Knock will inline all CSS included with your emails to ensure maximum compatibility across email clients.
- **Text generation**: We'll automatically generate a text version of your emails, so you never need to write both HTML and text templates.
- **Multiple layouts**: We support any number of emails layouts that can "wrap" your email templates and provide styles and shared elements like headers and footers.
- **Attachments support**: It's easy to send attachments alongside your emails, just pass through some Base64 encoded data along with your `workflow.trigger` call and you're done!
- **Link and open tracking**: Capture link-click and email-open events right within your Knock account. For more details, see the [Knock link and open tracking guide](/send-notifications/tracking).
