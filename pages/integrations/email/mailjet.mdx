Knock integrates with [Mailjet](https://mailjet.com/) to send email notifications to your users.

In this guide you'll learn how to get started sending transactional email notifications with Mailjet through Knock. We also cover provider configuration and additional data you can pass through to Mailjet. 

## Features

- Attachments support
- Delivery tracking
- Link and open tracking
- Per environment configuration
- Sandbox mode

## Getting started

You can create a new Mailjet channel in the dashboard under the "Channels" section. From there, you'll need to configure the channel for each environment you have.

## Provider configuration

<Attributes>
  <Attribute
    name="API key"
    type="string*"
    description="The public API key for your Mailjet account"
  />
  <Attribute
    name="API secret key"
    type="string*"
    description="The secret API key for your Mailjet account"
  />
  <Attribute
    name="Open tracking"
    type="boolean"
    description="Should the provider track opens on their service?"
  />
  <Attribute
    name="Link tracking"
    type="boolean"
    description="Should the provider track link clicks on their service?"
  />
  <Attribute
    name="From email address"
    type="string | liquid*"
    description="The sender email address (can use Liquid tags)"
  />
  <Attribute
    name="From name"
    type="string | liquid"
    description="The sender name (can use Liquid tags)"
  />
</Attributes>

## Environment default settings

The following fields are optional and if set, will be applied to all email messages sent via this channel within the environment:

<Attributes>
  <Attribute
    name="Reply-to address"
    type="string | liquid"
    description="The reply-to email address (can use Liquid tags)"
  />
  <Attribute
    name="CC address"
    type="string | liquid"
    description="The cc email address (can use Liquid tags)"
  />
  <Attribute
    name="BCC address"
    type="string | liquid"
    description="The bcc email address (can use Liquid tags)"
  />
</Attributes>

## Additional data sent

Knock sends the following attributes along with your emails:

- `CustomID`: the message ID attached to this email

You can learn about the role of this Mailjet attribute in the [Mailjet API documentation](https://dev.mailjet.com/).

## Recipient data requirements

In order to send an email notification you'll need a valid `email` property set on your recipient.
