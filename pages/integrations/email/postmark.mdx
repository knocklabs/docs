Knock integrates with [Postmark](https://postmark.com/) to send email notifications to your users.

## Features

- Attachments support
- Delivery tracking
- Link and open tracking
- Per environment configuration
- Sandbox mode

## Getting started

You can create a new Postmark channel in the dashboard under the "Channels" section. From there, you'll need to configure the channel for each environment you have.

## Provider configuration

<Attributes>
  <Attribute
    name="API key"
    type="string*"

  />
  <Attribute
    name="Open tracking"
    type="boolean"
    description="Should the provider track opens on their service?"
  />
  <Attribute
    name="Link tracking"
    type="boolean"
    description="Should the provider track link clicks on their service?"
  />
  <Attribute
    name="From email address"

  />
  <Attribute
    name="From name"
    type="string | liquid"
    description="The sender name (can use Liquid tags)"
  />
</Attributes>

## Environment default settings

The following fields are optional and if set, will be applied to all email message sent via this channel within the environment:

<Attributes>
  <Attribute
    name="Reply to address"
    type="string | liquid"
    description="The reply-to email address (can use Liquid tags)"
  />
  <Attribute
    name="CC address"
    type="string | liquid"
    description="The cc email address (can use Liquid tags)"
  />
  <Attribute
    name="BCC address"
    type="string | liquid"
    description="The bcc email address (can use Liquid tags)"
  />
</Attributes>

## Additional data sent

Knock sends the following attributes along with your emails:

- `Meta.sender`: always set to `knock.app`
- `Meta.knock_message_id`: the message ID attached to this email
- `Tag`: the key of the workflow this message was generated from

## Recipient data requirements

In order to send an email notification you'll need a valid `email` property set on your recipient.
