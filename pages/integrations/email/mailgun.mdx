## Additional data sent

Knock sends the following attributes along with your emails:

- `v:sender`: always set to `knock.app`
- `v:knock_message_id`: set to the message ID for the message being sent
- `o:tag`: the workflow key for the workflow being invoked

## Recipient data requirements

In order to send an email notification you'll need a valid `email` property set on your recipient.
