Knock integrates with [Mailgun](https://mailgun.com/) to send email notifications to your users.

In this guide you'll learn how to get started sending transactional email notifications with Mailgun through Knock. We also cover provider configuration and additional data you can pass through to Mailgun. 

## Features

- Attachments support
- Delivery tracking
- Link and open tracking
- Per environment configuration
- Sandbox mode

## Getting started

You can create a new Mailgun channel in the dashboard under the "Channels" section. From there, you'll need to configure the channel for each environment you have.

## Provider configuration

</Attributes>

## Environment default settings

The following fields are optional and if set, will be applied to all email messages sent via this channel within the environment:

<Attributes>
  <Attribute
    name="Reply-to address"
    type="string | liquid"
    description="The reply-to email address (can use Liquid tags)"
  />
  <Attribute
    name="CC address"
    type="string | liquid"

  />

  />
  <Attribute
    name="JSON overrides"
    type="string | liquid"
    description="Provider API's paramater overrides"
  />
</Attributes>

## Additional data sent

Knock sends the following attributes along with your emails:

- `v:sender`: always set to `knock.app`
- `v:knock_message_id`: set to the message ID for the message being sent
- `o:tag`: the workflow key for the workflow being invoked

You can learn about the role of these Mailgun attributes in the [Mailgun API documentation](https://documentation.mailgun.com/en/latest/quickstart.html).

## Recipient data requirements

In order to send an email notification you'll need a valid `email` property set on your recipient.
