In this guide we'll walk through how to configure an Expo provider in Knock. This guide assumes that you've already created an Expo channel in the Knock dashboard. 

## How to configure Expo with Knock
To configure Expo with Knock, you'll need your Expo project name (sometimes referred to as an `experience_id`) and your Expo auth token.

You can get both of these by logging into the [Expo console](update_me) and navigating to [chris to update]. Once you have them, go back to the environment configuration for your Expo channel, complete the configuration, and you're good to go.
