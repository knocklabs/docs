title: How to send push notifications to Firebase Cloud Messaging
---

In this guide we'll walk through how to configure a Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) provider in Knock. This guide assumes that you've already created an FCM channel in the Knock dashboard.

## How to configure Firebase with Knock

To configure FCM with Knock, you'll need your Firebase Project ID and the complete contents of your Service Account JSON file.

You can get both of these by logging into the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and navigating to project settings. Once you have them, go back to the environment configuration for your FCM channel, enter in your Project ID and Service Account JSON file, and you're good to go.

## Channel data requirements

In order to use a configured FCM channel you must store a list of one or more device tokens for the user or the object that you wish to deliver a notification to. You can retrieve a device token by following the guide on the [FCM developer documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/android/client).

| Property | Type     | Description               |
| -------- | -------- | ------------------------- |
| tokens\* | string[] | One or more device tokens |
