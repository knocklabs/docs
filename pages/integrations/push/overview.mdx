Knock supports sending push notifications directly to native services such as Apple Push Notifications system (for iOS notifications) and Firebase Cloud Messaging (for Android push notifications.) We also support delivery of notifications through push intermediary services such as Expo.

**Note:** If you use an intermediary we don't yet support, let us know through the feedback button at the top of this page! We can spin up new connections quickly.

In the following pages we provide in-depth integration guides for each of the providers we deliver push notifications to today.

In this overview page we cover a few general concepts that span across all of our push notification providers. Let's get to it.

## Configuring push providers in Knock

For each of the providers you use with Knock, you'll need to create a channel. You can create a channel under the Channels page of the Knock dashboard. Once you create a channel for your push provider, you'll be ready to configure that provider for each of your environments in Knock.

## Channel groups

When you create your first push channel in Knock, you'll notice that we offer a channel group that combines both Apple Push Notifications system and Firebase Cloud Messaging. If you are sending notifications directly to each of these services today, consider using a channel group in Knock.

A **channel group** can send to multiple providers at once from a single channel step within a workflow. Here's why that's powerful.

Without a channel group in place, any workflows that send push notifications will need two channel steps in place, one for Apple and one for Firebase. This can be valuable when you want to take advantage of provider-specific functionality, but in cases where you want to send identical notifications to both providers, it means duplicating (and maintaining) the notification design across both channel steps.

With a channel group in place, you can send identical notifications to Apple and Firebase, from the same channel step. This means you can design the notification once, and move on.

Channel groups are currently enabled on an on-demand basis. If you'd like it enabled for your account, you can request access in the dashboard or send us a note using the feedback button at the top of this page.
