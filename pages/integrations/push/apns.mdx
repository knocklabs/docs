title: How to send push notifications to Apple Push Notifications service
---

In this guide we'll walk through how to configure an Apple Push Notifications service (APNS) provider in Knock. This guide assumes that you've already created an APNS channel in the Knock dashboard.

## How to configure Apple Push Notifications service with Knock

There are two ways to configure APNS with Knock. You can use a token-based authentication scheme or a certificate-based authentication scheme. Depending on which you choose, you'll need to get different information from Xcode and your Apple developer account.

**Token v. cert-based authentication**

[We should include a quick blurb on which we recommend and tradeoffs between the two.]

## Channel data requirements

In order to use a configured APNS channel you must store a list of one or more device tokens for the user or the object that you wish to deliver a notification to. You can retrieve a device token by following the guide on the [Apple developer documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/registering_your_app_with_apns).

| Property | Type     | Description               |
| -------- | -------- | ------------------------- |
| tokens\* | string[] | One or more device tokens |
