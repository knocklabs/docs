title: How to send push notifications using Expo
---

In this guide we'll walk through how to configure an Expo provider in Knock. This guide assumes that you've already created an Expo channel in the Knock dashboard and that your React Native application is already setup to support Push notifications.

If you're new to setting up push in your Expo enabled React Native project, you can follow the [excellent setup guide in the Expo documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/push-notifications/overview/).

## How to configure Expo with Knock

To configure Expo with Knock, you'll need your Expo project name (sometimes referred to as an `experience_id`) and if you've enabled enhanced push security, you'll also need an auth token. You can read more about [Enhanced Push Security in the Expo docs](https://docs.expo.dev/push-notifications/sending-notifications/#additional-security).

You can get both of these by logging into the [Expo console](https://expo.dev/). Once you have them, go back to the environment configuration for your Expo channel, complete the configuration, and you're good to go.

## Channel data requirements

In order to use a configured Expo channel you must store a list of one or more device tokens for the user or the object that you wish to deliver a notification to. You can retrieve a device token by following the guide on the [Expo developer documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/push-notifications/push-notifications-setup/).

| Property | Type     | Description               |
| -------- | -------- | ------------------------- |
| tokens\* | string[] | One or more device tokens |
