Knock integrates with [Plivo](https://www.plivo.com/) to send SMS notifications to your recipients.

## Features

- Delivery tracking
- Per environment configuration
- Sandbox mode

## Getting started

You'll need to take the following steps in Plivo before you can configure your channel within Knock.

### 1.Create a Plivo account

[Sign up](https://console.plivo.com/accounts/register/) for a Plivo account in case you haven't already.
After doing this you will gain access to your dashboard where you can find your **Auth ID** and **Auth Token**

### 2. Verify a phone number

You can add a [sandbox number](https://console.plivo.com/phone-numbers/sandbox-numbers/) for testing or you can buy a
[plivo phone number](https://console.plivo.com/active-phone-numbers/) to use as the from field on your Knock channel

## Configuring Plivo in Knock

Now that you have your **verified phone number**, **Auth ID** and **Auth Token**, you're ready to configure your Plivo channel within Knock.

You can create a new Plivo channel in the dashboard under the "Channels" section. From there, you'll need to configure the channel for each environment you have.
