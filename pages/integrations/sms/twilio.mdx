Knock integrates with [Twilio](https://twilio.com/) to send SMS notifications to your recipients.

## Features

- Delivery tracking
- Per environment configuration
- Sandbox mode

## Getting started

We'll walk through a few steps to take in Twilio before jumping into how to configure Twilio within Knock.

### Twilio setup

Before you set up your Twilio SMS channel in Knock, you'll need to take the following steps in Twilio.

1. [Sign up](https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio) for a Twilio account if you haven't already.
2. [Get your first SMS-enabled phone number](https://www.twilio.com/docs/usage/tutorials/how-to-use-your-free-trial-account#get-your-first-twilio-phone-number) in Twilio. You'll use this as the "from" phone number in your channel configuration within Knock. (We also support Twilio [short codes](https://www.twilio.com/sms/short-codes) and [messaging services](https://www.twilio.com/docs/messaging/services), but we won't be covering those in this guide.)
3. If you're Twilio account is in trial mode, you'll need to [pre-verify any phone numbers with Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/docs/usage/tutorials/how-to-use-your-free-trial-account#verify-your-personal-phone-number) that you plan to send to from Knock during testing.

Once you've completed those steps, you're ready to start sending SMS notifications with Knock.

### Configure Twilio in Knock

You can create your Twilio channel under the "Channels" page in the Knock dashboard. Once the channel has been created, you'll need to configure each of your Knock environments to work with Twilio.

Each environment requires a Twilio account ID, an auth token, and a "from" resource within Twilio from which to send messages. This "from" resource can be a Twilio phone number, short code, or messaging service. (If you are using a phone number, keep in mind that all numbers used in Knock must be in [E.164 format](https://www.twilio.com/docs/glossary/what-e164).)

      mind that to configure Knock, you are looking for your Twilio account ID
      and auth token (not your API key). You can find these in the Twilio
      dashboard under "Account > General settings".

## Recipient data requirements

In order to send an SMS notification you'll need a valid `phone_number` property set on your recipient.
