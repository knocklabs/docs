resources:
  workflows:
    name: Workflows
    description: |-
      To define a logical flow for your notifications, you create a workflow consisting of steps. Workflow steps can be functions or channels, and can have conditional logic that determines whether to execute that step when the workflow is triggered.

      You can retrieve, update, or create a workflow as well as list all workflows in a given environment. Workflows are identified by their unique workflow key.
    subresources:
      steps:
        name: Steps
        description: |-
          Methods that operate on the individual steps within a workflow. Steps are referenced by their `ref`, which is unique within a workflow.
  templates:
    name: Templates
    description: |-
      Templates represent the templated contents of a message sent to an individual recipient on a specific channel. 

      There are no endpoints for working directly with templates, instead you must do so through [modifying a workflow](/mapi-reference/workflows).
  email_layouts:
    name: Email layouts
    description: |-
      [Email layouts](/integrations/email/layouts) wrap email message templates to share consistent design components between the email notifications that your recipients receive.

      You can create and update email layouts in your `development` environment, as well as retrieve or list all layouts in a given environment.
  environments:
    name: Environments
    description: |-
      Knock uses the concept of [environments](/concepts/environments) to ensure logical separation of your data. Dashboard resources are created in your `development` environment and promoted to higher environments.
  translations:
    name: Translations
    description: |-
      Translations support localization in Knock. They hold the translated content for a given locale, which you can reference in your message templates with the t Liquid function filter.

      You can retrieve, update, and create translations as well as list all translations in a given environment. Translations are identified by their locale code + an optional namespace.
  channels:
    name: Channels
    description: |-
      Channels are the delivery mechanisms for your notifications.
  partials:
    name: Partials
    description: |-
      Partials are reusable pieces of content you can use across your channel templates.

      You can retrieve, update, and create partials as well as list all partials in a given environment. Partials are identified by their unique partial key.
  commits:
    name: Commits
    description: |-
      To version the changes you make in your environments, Knock uses a commit model. When you make changes to a workflow, a layout, or a translation, you will need to commit them in your development environment, then promote to subsequent environments before those changes will appear in the respective environments.

      You can retrieve all commits in a given environment, or show the details of one single commit based on the target commit id.
  message_types:
    name: Message types
    description: |-
      A message type is a schema for a message that maps to a UI component or element within your application.
  variables:
    name: Variables
    description: |-
      Variables are used to store shared attributes for your workflows and templates at the environment level.
  api_keys:
    name: API keys
    description: |-
      API keys are used to authenticate requests to the Knock API.
  guides:
    name: Guides
    description: |-
      Guides let you define in-app messaging for your users, powered by your own components.
  broadcasts:
    name: Broadcasts
    description: |-
      [Broadcasts](/concepts/broadcasts) are a way to send one-time, cross-channel notifications to your users through Knock. They use the Knock workflow engine, but are configured in the Knock dashboard to run once.
  branches:
    name: Branches
    description: |-
      [Branches](/version-control/branches) are a way to isolate changes to your Knock resources.
  $shared:
    name: Shared
    description: |-
      Resources that are shared across the API.
