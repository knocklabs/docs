resources:
  workflows:
    name: Workflows
    description: |-
      A [Workflow](/concepts/workflows) orchestrates the delivery of messages to your end users. When you configure a workflow you'll determine which channels its messages should route to, what those messages should look like on each channel, as well as any functions—batch, throttle, digest—you want applied to the messages prior to delivery. A workflow is triggered by a `trigger` call, usually when something occurs in your product that you want your users to know about (e.g. a new comment.)
  messages:
    name: Messages
    description: |-
      A [Message](/concepts/messages) is a notification delivered on a particular channel to a user.
  users:
    name: Users
    description: |-
      A [User](/concepts/users) is an individual from your system, represented in Knock. They are most commonly a recipient of a notification.
  objects:
    name: Objects
    description: |-
      An [Object](/concepts/objects) represents a resource in your system that you've stored in Knock.
  tenants:
    name: Tenants
    description: |-
      A [Tenant](/concepts/tenants) represents a grouping with configurable settings that can be applied to a workflow when it's triggered in order to override account-level settings such as branding.
  schedules:
    name: Schedules
    description: |-
      A [Schedule](/concepts/schedules) allows you to automatically trigger a workflow at a given time for one or more recipients. You can think of a schedule as a managed, recipient-timezone-aware cron job that Knock will run on your behalf.
  audiences:
    name: Audiences
    description: |-
      An [Audience](/concepts/audiences) represents a user segment. Use the Audiences API to sync user segments from your data warehouse to Knock. Audiences can be used to target messages or orchestrate workflows via branch and step conditions. They can also be used as the recipient of a [Broadcast](/concepts/broadcasts).
  bulk_operations:
    name: Bulk Operations
    description: |-
      A [Bulk Operation](/concepts/bulk-operations) is a set of changes applied across 0 or more records triggered via a call to the Knock API and performed asynchronously. The BulkOperation record represents the state of the operation, including recording the number of rows that have been modified during the operation. Please note here: the estimated_total_rows field may have a different value to the processed_rows field due to the asynchronous nature of the operation.
