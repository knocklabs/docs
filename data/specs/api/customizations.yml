      A [Workflow](/concepts/workflows) orchestrates the delivery of messages to your end users. When you configure a workflow you'll determine which channels its messages should route to, what those messages should look like on each channel, as well as any [functions](/designing-workflows/overview#function-steps)—batch, throttle, delay—you want applied to the messages prior to delivery. 

      To send notifications, you’ll trigger your workflows. A workflow is triggered by a `trigger` call, typically when an event occurs in your product that you want your users to know about (e.g. a new comment.)
  messages:
    name: Messages
    description: |-
      A [Message](/concepts/messages) is a notification delivered on a particular channel to a user.
    subresources:
      batch:
        name: Batch Messages
        description: |-
          Operations that can be performed on a batch of messages.
  channels:
    name: Channels
    description: |-
      A [Channel](/concepts/channels) is a delivery method for a message.
    subresources:
      bulk:
        name: Bulk
        description: |-
          Bulk operations available for messages of a given channel.
  users:
    name: Users
    description: |-
      A [User](/concepts/users) is an individual from your system, represented in Knock. They are most commonly a recipient of a notification.
    subresources:
      feeds:
        name: Feeds
        description: |-
          A feed exposes the messages delivered to an in-app feed channel, formatted specially to be consumed in a notification feed. 
          
          A feed will always return a list of `FeedItems`, which are pointers to a message delivered and contain all of the information needed in order to render an item within a notification feed. 
          
          **Note: feeds are a specialized form of messages that are designed purely for in-app rendering, and as such return information that is required on the client to do so**
      guides:
        name: Guides
        description: |-
          A [Guide](/concepts/guides) is a collection of steps that can be used to guide a user through a workflow.
      bulk:
        name: Bulk
        description: |-
          Bulk operations available for users.
  objects:
    name: Objects
    description: |-
      An [Object](/concepts/objects) represents a resource in your system that you've stored in Knock.
    subresources:
      bulk:
        name: Bulk
        description: |-
          Bulk operations available for objects.
  tenants:
    name: Tenants
    description: |-
      A [Tenant](/concepts/tenants) represents a grouping with configurable settings that can be applied to a workflow when it's triggered in order to override account-level settings such as branding.
    subresources:
      bulk:
        name: Bulk
        description: |-
          Bulk operations available for tenants.
  recipients:
    name: Recipients
    description: |-
      A [Recipient](/concepts/recipients) represents an individual from your system, represented in Knock. They are most commonly a recipient of a notification.
    subresources:
      subscriptions:
        name: Subscriptions
        description: |-
          Subscriptions are a way to subscribe to events from a recipient.
      preferences:
        name: Preferences
        description: |-
          [Preferences](/concepts/preferences) determine whether a recipient should receive a particular type of notification. By default all preferences are opted in unless a preference explicitly opts the recipient out of the notification. 

          The preference set `:id` can be either `"default"` or a `tenant.id`. Learn more about [per-tenant preferences](/preferences/tenant-preferences).
      channel_data:
        name: Channel Data
        description: |-
          [Channel data](/managing-recipients/setting-channel-data) is channel-specific information stored on a Knock [user](/reference#users) or [object](/reference#objects) that's needed to deliver a notification to an end provider.

          For a push channel, this includes device-specific tokens that map the recipient to the device they use. For chat apps, such as Slack, this includes the access token used to send notifications to a customer's Slack channel.

          The shape of the `data` payload varies depending on the channel type; you can learn more about channel data schemas [here](/send-notifications/setting-channel-data#provider-data-requirements).
  schedules:
    name: Schedules
    description: |-
      A [Schedule](/concepts/schedules) allows you to automatically trigger a workflow at a given time for one or more recipients. You can think of a schedule as a managed, recipient-timezone-aware cron job that Knock will run on your behalf.
    subresources:
      bulk: 
        name: Bulk Schedules
        description: |-
          Bulk operations available for schedules.
  audiences:
    name: Audiences
    description: |-
      An [Audience](/concepts/audiences) represents a user segment. Use the Audiences API to sync user segments from your data warehouse to Knock. Audiences can be used to target messages or orchestrate workflows via branch and step conditions. They can also be used as the recipient of a [Broadcast](/concepts/broadcasts).
  bulk_operations:
    name: Bulk Operations
    description: |-
      A [Bulk Operation](/concepts/bulk-operations) is a set of changes applied across 0 or more records triggered via a call to the Knock API and performed asynchronously. The BulkOperation record represents the state of the operation, including recording the number of rows that have been modified during the operation. Please note here: the estimated_total_rows field may have a different value to the processed_rows field due to the asynchronous nature of the operation.
  providers:
    name: Providers
    description: |-
      A [Provider](/concepts/providers) is a channel-specific configuration that determines how a message is delivered to a recipient.
