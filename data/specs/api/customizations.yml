      A [Workflow](/concepts/workflows) orchestrates the delivery of messages to your end users. When you configure a workflow you'll determine which channels its messages should route to, what those messages should look like on each channel, as well as any functions—batch, throttle, digest—you want applied to the messages prior to delivery. A workflow is triggered by a `trigger` call, usually when something occurs in your product that you want your users to know about (e.g. a new comment.)
